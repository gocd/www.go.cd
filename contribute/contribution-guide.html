    <h3><a name="submit-bug"></a>Submit Bug</h3>
    <h4><a name="is-it-already-filed"></a>Check to see if it's already been filed</h4>
    <p>We're using <a href="https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues">GitHub Issues</a> to track bugs and enhancements on this project. Please go there and check if someone has already reported the same issue or made the same enhancement request. There's a good chance that if they have, there may be information which will benefit you.</p>

    <a name="ask-the-community"></a><h4>Ask the community</h4>
    <p>If you're not sure the behavior you're seeing is a bug, you can always ask on our <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/go-cd">user's group</a> or <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/go-cd-dev">developer's group</a>.</p>

    <a name="be-as-complete-as-possible"></a><h4>Be as complete as possible</h4>
    <p>We understand that you can't be expected to know exactly why something doesn't work, but just saying "it doesn't work" doesn't help us help you. Adding as much information as possible into your report is very important.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Describe what you were doing when you ran into the issue</li>
        <li>Describe what you expected to happen</li>
        <li>Describe what actually happened</li>
        <li>Let us know exactly which version of Go you're using (it's on the bottom of every page)

            <ul>
                <li>By the way, if you're using a very old version it's possible the bug has already been fixed.</li>
                <li>Also by the way, if you're using a very recent build and not a supported release it's possible you're using some feature that's not done.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Let us know what operating system your server and agents are installed on</li>
        <li>Let us know which web browser(s) you were using</li>
    </ul>

    <a name="some-things-we-may-ask-for"></a><h4>Some things we may ask for</h4>
    <p>We don't always need all of these, but if you'd like to attach them when you submit your issue it definitely couldn't hurt.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Screen shots of errors when they show up in the user interface</li>
        <li>The output of http://[YOUR_GO_URL]/go/api/support</li>
        <li>The configuration and log files listed on the page above.</li>
    </ul>

    <a name="if-you-really-want-to-help"></a><h4>If you REALLY want to help</h4>
    <p>As we said above, just finding and submitting issues is helpful. If you're so inclined, a pull request or even a patch which addresses the issue is even better!</p>

        </code>
    </div>
    <p>Push to your remote:</p>
    <div class="highlight">
        <code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">$ git push mine
    </code>
    </div>
    <p>You might have cloned your forked repository on your machine and might want to add the original Go repository as a remote instead, if that's the case here's what you have to do.</p>

    <p>In the directory you cloned your fork:</p>
    <div class="highlight">
        <code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">$ git remote add go-cd git://github.com/gocd/gocd.git
        </code>
    
    </div>
    <p>Download new commits and branches from the official repository:</p>
    <div class="highlight">
        <code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">$ git fetch go-cd
    </code>
    </div>
    <p>Merge the new content:</p>
    <div class="highlight">
        <code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">
        $ git checkout master 
        $ git rebase go-cd/master
        </code>
    </div>
    <p>Update your fork:</p>
    <div class="highlight">
        <code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">$ git push origin master

    Visit <a href="https://github.com/gocd/documentation/blob/master/developer/2/2.1.md">this</a>.

    <a name="tell-us-what-you-are-trying-to-do"></a><h4>Tell us what you are trying to do!</h4>
    <p>Before getting started on anything (bug/feature) please do talk to us on <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/go-cd-dev">developer's group</a>. This helps everybody to be on the same page, i.e. we know who is working on what allowing us manage the project efficiently. It will save you effort if you are trying to do something that is already fixed or cannot be fixed due to some limitation! It will also help us help you with the code. We will let you know about things that we think are important. Ex: We might want you to refactor some code as part of this.</p>
    <a name="make-sure-there-is-an-issue-logged-for-it"></a><h4>Make sure there is an <a href="https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues">issue</a> logged for it.</h4>
    <p>When you talk to us about it we will make sure the issue is logged and assigned to you. You should use this issue number in your commit message &amp; pull request comment.</p>
    <a name="write-tests-then-code"></a><h4>Write Tests &amp; Then Code</h4>
    <p>Understand the feature by reading <a href="http://www.go.cd/documentation/user/current/">user docs</a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/gocd/documentation">design docs</a>.</p>
    <p>Debug the flow to make sure you understand the code fully.</p>
    <p>Follow <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">Test Driven Development</a> (TDD) while you write code. i.e. if you are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>fixing a bug write a failing test first which reproduces the scenario and then fix the bug.</li>
        <li>writing a new feature write tests which assert the particular behavior you are expecting in the new feature &amp; then implement it.</li>
    </ul>

    <a name="granularity-of-change"></a><h4>Granularity of change (<a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/Contributor_Guide#Granularity_of_Changes">credits</a>)</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Make small commits, as small as reasonable. This makes them easy to review.</li>
        <li>Make sure you mention the issue number for the bug / feature that you are coding towards. Commit message format should be: # &lt; issue number &gt; - &lt; short message &gt;</li>
        <li>Each commit should have a commit message that explains very clearly what the commit sets out to achieve (unless this is abundantly clear from the code itself, which is basically only the case for trivial patches). Also, when you fix a bug then report which bug you fix. When there are deeper reasons for doing things the way the commit does, then explain these as well. This all is for the reviewers and yourself: the context of the commit is completely clear.</li>
        <li>Do not mix concerns in commits: have a commit do a single thing. This makes them reviewable 'in isolation'. The purpose of the commit is clear and can be understood easily by the reviewers and yourself.</li>
        <li>Write new tests for any commit: this is very important for bug hunting.</li>
        <li>Split your work into multiple smaller pieces of work (when possible) and implement each of these pieces in a series of commits.</li>
        <li>A series of commits should work towards a 'feature' in a clear way and only 'enable' the feature in the last commit of the series.</li>
        <li>In a series of commits first lay the groundwork and then build on that towards the feature.</li>
        <li>Do not mix concerns in branches: when you encounter a bug while working on something then create a new branch to fix the bug. If your work depends on the bug being fixed then rebase your work on that new branch.</li>
    </ul>

    <a name="try-not-to-break-the-build"></a><h4>Try not to break the build</h4>
    <p>On Go we follow TDD. Which means most of the code is covered with tests. When you make a change to the code expect tests to fail!</p>
    <p>You will need to make sure your code does not break anything, which means running tests that are around your code. We know this does not guarantee all tests will pass but we expect you to have done this before issuing a pull request.</p>

    <a name="issue-pull-request"></a><h4>Issue Pull Request</h4>
    <p>Navigate to the Go repository you just pushed to (e.g. https://github.com/your-user-name/gocd) and click on "Pull Requests" seen in the right panel. On the next page, press "New pull request" in the upper right hand corner.</p>
    <p>Click on "Edit", if you need to change the branches being compared (it compares "master" by default) and press "Click to create a pull request for this comparison".</p>
    <p>Ensure the changesets you introduced are included. Fill in some details about your potential patch including a meaningful title. When finished, press "Send pull request". The committers will be notified about your submission.</p>







    <h3><a name="review-process"></a>Code Review Process</h3>
    <a name="get-feedback"></a><h4>Get Feedback</h4>
    <p>Most pull requests will go through a few iterations before they get merged. Different contributors will sometimes have different opinions, and often patches will need to be revised before they can get merged.</p>

    <p>Some contributors to Go have email notifications from GitHub turned on, but others do not. Don't despair! Sometimes it's quick, sometimes it's slow. Such is the open source life.</p>

    <p>If it's been over a week, and you haven't heard anything, you might want to try and nudge things along. You can use the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/go-cd-dev">developer's group</a> mailing list for this. You can also leave another comment on the pull request.</p>

    <p>While you're waiting for feedback on your pull request, open up a few other pull requests and give someone else some feedback! I'm sure they'll appreciate it in the same way that you appreciate feedback on your patches.</p>

    <a name="iterate-as-necessary"></a><h4>Iterate as necessary</h4>

    <p>It's entirely possible that the feedback you get will suggest changes. Don't get discouraged: the whole point of contributing to an active open source project is to tap into community knowledge. If people are encouraging you to tweak your code, then it's worth making the tweaks and resubmitting.</p>

    <h3><a name="after-commit-is-merged"></a>After Commit is merged</h3>

    <a name="build"></a><h4>Build</h4>
    <p>We build Go using Go! So once your commit is merged relevant pipelines get triggered. You can track them <a href="https://build.go.cd/">here</a>.

    </ul>

    <a name="spec-unit-test-integration-test-failures"></a><h4>Spec, Unit test, Integration test failures</h4>

    <p>After the commit is merged there might be Spec failures (rails) or Unit / Integration test failures (Java), in which case we will notify you about the failures &amp; revert your commit so that you can fix them and issue a fresh pull request.</p>

    <a name="acceptance-test-failures"></a><h4>Acceptance test failures</h4>

    <p>We have significant amount of acceptance tests written in <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/products/twist-agile-testing">Twist</a> that test features end-to-end. If there is acceptance failure which is genuine, again, we will notify you about it. If its a failure because of change of behavior &amp; tests need to be changed then we will take care of doing that.</p>
