      <p>In order to compete in today's IT market, you must be truly agile, you must listen
to your customers and deliver features in a timely manner. In order to support business
development and marketing in their lean strategies we, as developers, must leverage
fast deliveries and deployments and test automations. Continuous Delivery makes it possible
to continuously adapt software in line with user feedback, shifts in the market and changes
of business strategy. Testing, support, development and operations work together as one
delivery team to automate and streamline the build, test and release process.</p>

<p>There are a lot of quality tools out there. For a long time, we used Jenkins as the most
widespread CD tool, with a great community and a lot of plugins and integrations with
other tools. What we lacked was a natural pipeline flow and good visualization. We also
lacked some more advanced features like pipeline dependencies, conditional triggering jobs
from many pipelines, templating etc. We needed to look elsewhere and we decided to go with
GoCD, a product by ThoughtWorks which became open source in 2014. It is a Java/Ruby on Rails
advanced continuous integration and release management system, according to their website.
The major reason why we chose it was that they modeled pipelines as first class citizens
and that, in our opinion, it used right abstraction for delivery pipeline.
But let us start from the beginning.</p>

<h2 id="gocd-overview">GoCD overview</h2>

<p>At the highest level, Go consists of two main components, the Go Server and multiple Go Agents.
The system works on a pull model where agents periodically poll the server for work.</p>

<p><img src="../../../../assets/images/blog/go-cd-continuous-delivery-through-pipelines/goCD-architecture-f39bda5b.png" title="GoCD Architecture" alt="GoCD Architecture" /></p>

<p>The main flow of Go goes through a couple of following stages:</p>

<ol>
  <li>User adds a pipeline with material</li>
  <li>MDU (material update sub-system) notices a new commit</li>
  <li>Scheduler schedules a build</li>
  <li>Go agents poll for work and get assignments</li>
  <li>Agent does the work</li>
</ol>

<p>Let's talk about the main building blocks of Go. As stated before, the main abstract is a
<strong>pipeline</strong> which is the highest unit of work with its inputs and outputs. The input object
of one pipeline is called a <strong>material</strong> and it can be either a version control resource
(Git, Gerrit, Subversion, Mercurial) or an output from another pipeline. The output of a
pipeline is called an <strong>artifact</strong>. Since there is one server and multiple agents,
there is no guarantee that the whole pipeline will be performed by the same Go agent.
Artifacts are copied to Go server and picked up by agents that require them for their jobs.</p>

<p>Each pipeline consists of one or more <strong>stages</strong>, where each stage has one or more <strong>jobs</strong> and
each job has one or more <strong>tasks</strong>. Granularity to this level of details is done because of
parallelism. Inside pipeline stages are sequential and can be triggered automatically on
success or manually. Within each stage, jobs are parallel. The outcome of a stage is considered
as failure if at least one job fails. Again, tasks within each job are also sequential.</p>

<p>After installing Go server and client there is no need for an extensive configuration.
However, it is recommended to create a separate partition on a computer's hard disk for
Go server artifacts (artifacts can grow over time and problems may occur). In server
configuration, there is also an admin tab for URL configuration. We needed to get feedback
on failing builds, so we integrated Go with LDAP so each user of Go had an email and could
subscribe on build information based on preferred filters.
Here is a <a href="https://docs.gocd.org/current/configuration/dev_authentication.html">link</a>
which explains the authentication process.</p>

<p>It is worth mentioning that GoCD has a powerful API for power users where the entire
configuration can be performed via REST. It has great documentation with examples,
JSON requests and response. Here is a link to
<a href="https://api.gocd.org/current/#introduction">GoCD API documentation</a>.</p>

<h2 id="pipeline-dependencies">Pipeline dependencies</h2>

<p>Go supports pipeline dependencies. Artifacts defined in upstream dependencies can be
accessed by downstream dependency. Downstream pipeline can be configured either to
be triggered automatically (for example for building on development environment) or
manually (for example for building on production environment).</p>

<p>Multiple pipeline dependency is called <strong>fan-in</strong> and it ensures that pipeline is triggered
only when all upstream dependencies finish. Upstream dependencies consist of other
pipelines or version control which make them powerful. If you have a client server
application and have functional tests on the client's side, which depend on the server
being updated, you can make a client functional test pipeline which will trigger on commit
on client and successful build and deploy of server side.</p>

<p><img src="../../../../assets/images/blog/go-cd-continuous-delivery-through-pipelines/goCD-fanIn-4f7b1e3b.png" title="Pipeline dependencies tab showing fan-in" alt="GoCD pipeline dependencies tab showing fan-in" /></p>

<p>The additional challenge here is a diamond-like dependency, where it is not enough for both
upstream dependencies to finish but to have right versions. The following diagram depicts
that problem. Here, configuration is really important, C1 must be set as material for both
C2 and C3 and C2 and C3 are materials for the pipeline Package. The package will auto trigger
when both C2 and C3 go green with the same version of code.</p>

<p><img src="../../../../assets/images/blog/go-cd-continuous-delivery-through-pipelines/dieamond-problem-6c3b1401.png" title="Pipeline dependencies show a Diamond dependency Problem" alt="Pipeline dependencies show a Diamond dependency Problem" /></p>

<h2 id="pipeline-templates">Pipeline templates</h2>

<p>Template engine is a great effort and time saver. Each pipeline can be promoted to template
and, based on that template, other pipelines can be built with a few clicks. We used this
extensively for deployment pipelines. Usually, there are multiple environments
(development, stage, UAT, production) and deployment process is the same with only a
few parameters which are different. You can create one deployment pipeline and test it.
When you make sure it works, extract the template out of it and clone the deployment
pipelines for other environments. Differences can usually be covered with a couple of
parameters, which can be created upon pipeline creation.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In the introductory part, we mentioned that pipelines are modeled in GoCD as first
class citizens. In Jenkins, you can order a row of boxes and let the flow go through
each one of them until it finishes. Each box here in Jenkins is equivalent to each task
in GoCD. Moreover, in GoCD, each box is pipeline itself with its stages, jobs and tasks.</p>

<p>GoCD is a fairly new player in the automation world with refreshing UI and a couple of
nice concepts. The community is still growing but it is responsive. We had a couple of
problems which we posted on StackOverflow and usually got answers pretty quickly.
We are using <a href="https://github.com/ashwanthkumar/gocd-build-github-pull-requests">Gerrit/Github plugin</a>
to notify Github PR on failed or passed build which is being actively developed.
New releases are pushed frequently. Documentation is great, especially API documentation.
It's our pleasure to use such a great UI and a couple of nice advanced features.
You have a possibility to model your pipeline in a great variety of ways.
There are some features missing but we in <a href="https://www.smartcat.io/">SmartCat</a> are all
about open source so, in the future, we will try to help this project and start contributing.</p>
