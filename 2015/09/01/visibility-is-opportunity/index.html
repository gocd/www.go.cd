      <h1 id="visibility-can-be-hard-but-its-worth-it">Visibility can be hard, but it's worth it.</h1>

<p><a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/mingle">Mingle</a> is a 9 years JRuby Rails project.
We do test-driven development and continuous integration.
We write selenium tests to test everything since Oct 2006.</p>

<p>For a long time, our <strong>build time was 1 to 2 hours</strong>.
We thought it was a good balance of build time and resources needed.</p>

<p>2014, we had about 12+K tests, including units, functionals and selenium tests.
The best build time was 1 hour ran in parallel on 46 VMs.</p>

<p>We ran test in parallel by <a href="https://gocd.org">Go CD</a> jobs and <a href="https://github.com/test-load-balancer/tlb">TLB</a>.
There were 46 test jobs in one <a href="https://gocd.org">Go CD</a> stage.
Units, functionals and selenium tests were different.
So We created 3 <a href="https://github.com/test-load-balancer/tlb">TLB</a> tasks to distribute them separately.
We configured <a href="https://github.com/test-load-balancer/tlb">TLB</a> to distribute tests by test runtime for having similar build time.</p>

<p>When I looked for ideas to improve build performance, I had the following questions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Where was time spending when test was running?</li>
  <li>Were there bottlenecks in test code?</li>
</ol>

<p>Profiling was an obvious option, but it was challenge to profile build.
Because:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Profiling one test won't help. To figure out what's bottleneck for entire build, we need profile all tests running.</li>
  <li>Profiling generates lots of data. 1 hour build on 46 VMs will generate tons of data.</li>
  <li>We need merge/aggregate data collected from build VMs for analysis.</li>
</ol>

<p>It turns out, sampling profiler can be a good tool for this job. But Mingle is on Ruby 1.8.
There wasn't sampling profiler support it.
So I wrote <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/sampling_prof">Sampling Profiler</a> and a data analysis web application to do the job:</p>

<ol>
  <li>First I ran <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/sampling_prof">Sampling Profiler</a> with test on build.</li>
  <li>Then sent all profiling call-graph data to the data analysis web application.</li>
  <li>Data analysis web application merges same build profiling result.</li>
  <li>Last, I built UI to navigate through profiling result.</li>
</ol>

<p>After I did it, test code performance improvement became straightforward.
The biggest surprise I found was test slept 1 hour on build in total.
The following code was one example:</p>

<p>{% highlight ruby %}
Timeout::timeout(time / 1000.0) do
  # wait until given JavaScript condition is true
  while get_eval(condition).downcase == "false"
    sleep 1
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}</p>

<p>The <code>sleep 1</code> code above caused build slept about 40+ minutes in total.
Changing <code>sleep 1</code> to <code>sleep 0.1</code> fixed problem.</p>

<p>Although there was no big bottleneck found, I was able to list and fix a handful small bottlenecks.
Our <strong>build time reduced to 45 minutes</strong>, and became more stable.</p>

<p><strong>You're on the right track when you're improving visibility of the problem details. It can be hard. But hard work pays off.</strong></p>

<h1 id="detail-can-lead-you-to-the-truth">Detail can lead you to the truth.</h1>

<p>Recently, our build became unstable (more random failures) and longer (1 hour) again.
I got time to look into build performance again.
My teammate <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/profiles/jeff-norris">Jeff Norris</a> noticed it was too slow when running selenium test on build VM.
I realized we had not paid attention to our VM performance.
Our VMs ran with 1 vertual CPU and 3.5 GB memory.
To run a selenium test, we need launch 3 processes:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/mingle">Mingle</a> application server for testing</li>
  <li>Selenium proxy server</li>
  <li>Selenium test.</li>
</ol>

<p>It is possible that 1 vertual CPU is not enough.
So we increased build VMs to 2 vCPU.
Build time decreased to 50 minutes.
The result was not as good as we thought.
So I compared all jobs runtime.
It turned out some selenium test jobs ran twice faster than other selenium test jobs.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://github.com/test-load-balancer/tlb">TLB</a> balanced our selenium tests by time, we expect job runtime similar.
My first hypothesis was <a href="https://github.com/test-load-balancer/tlb">TLB</a> may not work as expected.
Because tests didn't seem to be distributed well by runtime.
To verify my hypothesis, I checked out <a href="https://github.com/test-load-balancer/tlb">TLB</a> source code. It was more complex than I thought.
And there is also no way to output more logs to verify it's correctness.
But <a href="https://gocd.org">Go CD</a> has good support for APIs, so I wrote <a href="https://github.com/ThoughtWorksStudios/goapi/blob/master/examples/compare_test_runtime.rb">Ruby script</a> to verify my hypothesis.</p>

<p>The following chart shows how the test runtime looks like on build. X-axis is job names; y-axis is job runtime.</p>

<p><img src="../../../../assets/images/acceptnace-test-build-time-6e0b8af7.png" title="Graph representing Acceptance Test time" alt="Graph representing Acceptance Test time" /></p>

<p>Blue bars are test runtime on job. Red bars are "expected time", because <a href="https://github.com/test-load-balancer/tlb">TLB</a> distributed tests by previous build test runtime.
Red bars are test runtime calculated by previous build test runtime:</p>

<pre><code>Job expected runtime = sum of each test runtime in previous build
</code></pre>

<p>From this result, we can see the balance is not perfect, but OK.
Because red bars are similar high across all acceptance (selenium test) jobs.</p>

<p>Blue bars matched what I observed on build time.
Then I ran same script on more builds. The outputs were similar, just different jobs got longer time to run.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://gocd.org">Go CD</a> random picked up build VMs to run any job, it gave me a clue that maybe its build VM performance issue.
So I wrote another <a href="https://github.com/ThoughtWorksStudios/goapi/blob/master/examples/agent_stats.rb">script</a> to build the following chart:</p>

<p><img src="../../../../assets/images/vms-build-time-7ae5af26.jpg" title="Graph displaying GoCD build agent runtime" alt="Graph displaying GoCD build agent runtime" /></p>

<p>It's clear there are some VMs are consistent slower than others.
Then Barrow Kwan found out 2 of our VMs hosts were overloaded when we increased vCPUs on our VMs.
We have set the host NOT to overload the CPU core but there was a typo in configuration.
After sorted out VM host CPU overload issue, our <strong>build time reduced to 30 minutes</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>So, don't just assume, prove it with detailed data. Make details visible. It leads you to the truth.</strong></p>

<h1 id="you-dont-know-what-you-dont-know">You don't know what you don't know.</h1>

<p><a href="https://gocd.org">Go CD</a> introduced "timestamps in console logs" in release 15.1.
It made build task runtime visible.
I was not pay attention to the timestamps in the console logs until recently.
The following screenshot shows an example:</p>

<p><img src="../../../../assets/images/timestamps-in-console-logs-example-eb317f14.png" title="Timestamps in console logs" alt="Timestamps in console logs" /></p>

<p>It turns out, <a href="https://github.com/test-load-balancer/tlb.rb">tlb.rb</a> client we used has the following code:</p>

<p>{% highlight ruby %}
def self.get path
  sleep 2
  Net::HTTP.get_response(host, path, port).body
end
{% endhighlight %}</p>

<p>It only sleeps 2 seconds for one call, but it is called lots of times at the end of tests ran.
After removed code <code>sleep 2</code>, there is almost no time spent at the end of test anymore.</p>

<p>Without "timestamps in console logs", it is something like following:</p>

<p><img src="../../../../assets/images/no-timestamps-in-console-logs-example-a63eaf2d.png" title="No timestanps in console logs" alt="No timestanps in console logs" /></p>

<p>No one will notice it ever.</p>

<p>The benefit of fixing this problem is outstanding for our <strong>pre-commit build</strong>.
Pre-commit build is a build running a test suite before developer pushes changes to trunk repository.
Our pre-commit build runs all unit and functional tests.
The <strong>build time reduced from 18 minutes to 10 minutes</strong> with 20 processes on 3 machines.</p>

<p><strong>So, use/build tools that keep information visible,
you may be surprised what you can get from it.</strong></p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>Each time we improved our CI build performance, we thought that's the best we could do.
But it was not true overtime.</p>

<p>We found something, but missed other parts.
So when you look into a problem, don't assume how it works.
Working for better understanding instead.
There are various ways to gain more understanding of the problem:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Start from scratch.</li>
  <li>Look from different point of view.</li>
  <li>Make hypothesis and verify it.</li>
  <li>Find out more details of the problem.</li>
  <li>Learn from resolving similar problems.</li>
  <li>…</li>
</ul>

<p>Visibility of the problem detail supports you hunting helpful data.
Thus it gives you more opportunities to understand and solve problem.</p>
