THOUGHTWORKS DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES WILL MEET CUSTOMER'S REQUIREMENTS, OR THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR OR DEFECT FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE SERVICES WILL BE CORRECTED.</li>
	          <li><strong>Indemnity.</strong> ThoughtWorks will defend or settle, at its expense, any action brought against Customer based upon the claim that the Services, when used in accordance with this Agreement, infringe an issued U.S. patent or registered copyright; provided, however, that: (i) Customer notifies ThoughtWorks promptly in writing of any such claim; (ii) Customer does not enter into any settlement related to any claim without ThoughtWorks' prior written consent; (iii) ThoughtWorks has sole control of any claim and all related settlement negotiations; and (iv) as requested, Customer provides ThoughtWorks with all information and assistance necessary to settle or defend the claim.</li>

	              <li>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE SOFTWARE, GOODS OR SERVICES, OR SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL LOSS OR DAMAGES, EITHER IN CONTRACT OR TORT, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THAT RESULT FROM THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES, EVEN IF THOUGHTWORKS IS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY. IN ADDITION, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY'S TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES AND CAUSES OF ACTION EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID OR TO BE PAID BY CUSTOMER UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. TO THE EXTENT THAT LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY CAUSED BY ITS NEGLIGENCE, CAUSED BY FRAUDULENT MISREPRESENTATION OR DECEIT, OR ANY OTHER LIABILITY THAT MAY NOT BE EXCLUDED OR LIMITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER PARTY EXCLUDES OR LIMIT ITS LIABILITY.</li>
	              <li>The Parties agree that the limitations on and exclusions of liability listed in this Section 5 were freely negotiated and are an integral part of the bargain, in that the Services would not have been available for the same price and under the same terms and conditions had such limitations on and exclusions of liability not been included in this Agreement.</li>
	              <li>To the extent the foregoing warranty disclaimer or limitation of liability is not allowed by applicable law, then the liability of ThoughtWorks, and Customer's remedy, shall be limited to, at ThoughtWorks' option: (i) the re-supply of any defective Services; or (ii) the refund of any Support Fees paid by Customer for the period within which defective Services were performed.</li>

	            <ol class="level3">
	              <li>As used in this Agreement, "Confidential Information" means all information, and all documents and other tangible materials and things which record it, relating to, or used in either party's business, whether or not Trade Secret Information (as defined below), and whether owned by either party, any of their clients, or any third party vendor, which is not generally known to the public, or to either party's or their clients' competitors, and was disclosed to either party to this Agreement by the other party. Confidential Information includes, without limitation, the following especially sensitive types of information which are owned or used by either party, or owned by either party's clients, or third party vendors: (1) business channels, business plans, product development and marketing plans, advertising programs, and planning and merchandising strategies; (2) technical information, including formulae, pricing information, processes and methods of production; (3) Trade Secret Information (as defined hereafter), manuals, ideas, know-how, research-in-progress, work-in-progress, prototypes, and the like; (4) the identity, purchase and payment patterns of, and special relations with, customers and prospective customers; (5) the identity, net prices and credit terms of, and special relations with, suppliers and shippers; (6) computer programs, software, computer systems, computer logic, algorithms, individual computer designed features, computer or software features, methods, processes, program or system documentation, data, object codes and source codes and system or software design criteria; (7) business records and financial information; (8) information relating to hiring procedures and assessments; (9) personally identifiable information of employees; and (9) any other information or documents which either party reasonably regards as being confidential.</li>
	              <li>As used in the Agreement, "Trade Secret Information" means Confidential Information, and all documents and other tangible materials and things which record it, and which: (1) has economic value, actual or potential, from not being known by others who could obtain economic value from its disclosure or use; and (2) is the subject of reasonable efforts to maintain its secrecy.</li>
	              <li>Excluded Information. Confidential Information does not include information which: (i) is in or comes into the public domain other than as a result of a disclosure by the party hereto to whom it was disclosed pursuant to this Agreement (the "Receiving Party"), (ii) was known or within Receiving Party's possession prior to its being furnished by or on behalf of the other party hereto (the "Disclosing Party"), (iii) becomes available to the Receiving Party from a source other than the Disclosing Party or any of its representatives, provided that such source is not, to the Receiving Party's knowledge, bound by an obligation of confidentiality to the Disclosing Party or any other party with respect to such information, or (iv) was independently developed by the Receiving Party without reference to the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information.</li>
	              <li>Use and Disclosure. The parties will use Confidential Information of the other party solely for the purposes of evaluating the advisability of an engagement or in the course of the engagement itself, shall keep it confidential, and will not, except as set forth in the following paragraph, disclose any of the other party's Confidential Information in any manner whatsoever. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to grant any rights under any patent, copyright or other intellectual property rights of any party in favor of the other, nor shall this Agreement be construed to grant any party any rights in or to either party's Confidential Information, except the limited right to use such Confidential Information in connection with the proposed relationship between the parties.</li>
	              <li>Further Exceptions. Either party may disclose Confidential Information without being in violation of this Agreement under any of the following circumstances: (i) with the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party; (ii) to its employees, representatives, consultants or agents, solely for the purpose of assisting the Receiving Party with the engagement, but only if such person has been informed of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information and is obligated to maintain its confidentiality; or (iii) as required by law, legal process or the rules of any applicable stock exchange, in which event the Receiving Party shall give the Disclosing Party prompt notice thereof so that the Disclosing Party may seek a protective order and/or waive the duty of nondisclosure (except to the extent that the Receiving Party's provision of such notice would cause it to violate a court order or other legal requirement); provided that in the absence of such order or waiver, if the Receiving Party or any such representative shall, in the opinion of its counsel, stand liable for contempt or suffer other censure or penalty for failure to disclose, disclosure pursuant to the order of such tribunal may be made by the Receiving Party or its representative without liability hereunder.</li>
	              <li>Return of Information. At any time upon request of a Disclosing Party for any reason, the Receiving Party will promptly destroy or deliver to the Disclosing Party all documents (and all copies thereof) furnished to the Receiving Party by or on behalf of the Disclosing Party, and all documents created by the Receiving Party in reliance on documents and information furnished to the Receiving Party by or on behalf of the Disclosing Party. Notwithstanding the return of the Confidential Information the Receiving Party will continue to be bound by its obligations of confidentiality and non-use hereunder. Provided the Receiving Party continues to comply with this Agreement, the Receiving Party may retain any Confidential Information that: (a) is included in any back ups made in the ordinary course of its business which are not capable of ready search and deletion; (b) the Receiving Party is required by law or any Regulatory Requirement to retain, or needs to retain to defend itself in any proceeding being brought or threatened against it at the time the Confidential Information must be returned or destroyed; or (c) the Receiving Party is required to retain for its own reasonable internal credit, risk, insurance, taxation or record-keeping purposes.</li>

	          <li>Any controversy or dispute between the parties shall be settled first by negotiation between a Customer Named Contact and the ThoughtWorks Support Manager. In the event the representatives are unable to resolve the dispute within ninety (90) days, the parties agree to elevate the dispute to their respective Presidents or equivalent officer. If, after sixty (60) days, the parties are still unable to resolve the dispute, the Parties shall participate in mediation pursuant to the then-current JAMS International Mediation Rules. If mediation is unsuccessful, then the Parties will resolve the dispute by binding arbitration before a single, mutually agreed upon arbitrator with at least ten (10) years of experience in the field of software support services, regardless of the amount in dispute. The arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules, except as set forth herein. The decision and award of the arbitrator shall be final and binding and the award so rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitration shall be held in Chicago, Illinois. No damages excluded by or in excess of any damage limitations set forth in this Agreement, including punitive or other non-compensatory damages, shall be awarded. Nothing herein contained shall bar the right of either party to obtain equitable relief from a court of law or equity with regard to a claim under the Confidentiality Agreement.</li>
	          <li>This Agreement shall be deemed executed in the State of Delaware, U.S.A., and shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to choice of law or conflict of law principles. For purposes of enforcement of arbitration awards, equitable relief, or if for any other reason litigation is permissible under this agreement, each party hereby irrevocably agrees to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of any court located in the State of Delaware.</li>

	        <p>No failure or delay by either party in exercising any right, power, or privilege granted under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any right, power or privilege granted under this Agreement. The knowing waiver of a Breach of this Agreement or the failure of a party to exercise any right under this Agreement shall in no event constitute a waiver as to any other breach, whether similar or dissimilar in nature, or prevent the exercise of any right under this Agreement.</p>
	      </li>

	      <li>
	        <div class="title">Amendment</div>

	        <p>This Agreement can only be modified by mutual written assent of the parties.
