                <p>Licensee shall ensure that its use of the Product is only for the Authorized Use. Licensee shall not
                    distribute the Product. Licensee shall take reasonable security measures to prevent any prohibited

                <div class="title">INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY &amp; CONFIDENTIALITY</div>
                <p>ThoughtWorks hereby reserves all rights not explicitly granted in this Agreement. The Product
                    contains copyrighted material, trade secrets and other valuable confidential and proprietary
                    information owned by ThoughtWorks. This license confers no right, title, or ownership interest in or
                    to any copyright, trademark, logo, or trade name of ThoughtWorks and all associated intellectual
                    property rights are retained by ThoughtWorks.</p></li>
            <li>
                <div class="title">LIMITED WARRANTY &amp; LIABILITY</div>
                <p>a) ThoughtWorks provides the Product “as is” and “as available” without warranty of any kind, either
                    express or implied, including but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability,
                    satisfactory quality, and fitness for a particular purpose. ThoughtWorks does not warrant that the
                    functions contained in the Product will meet Licensee’s requirements, or that the operation of the
                    Product will be uninterrupted or error or defect free, or that defects in the Product will be
                    corrected.</p>

                <p>b) Under no circumstances, including negligence, shall ThoughtWorks be liable for any lost profits,
                    loss of data, cost of procurement of substitute software, goods or services, or special, indirect,
                    incidental or consequential loss or damages, either in contract or tort, arising out of or in
                    connection with this Agreement or that result from the use or inability to use the Product, even if
                    ThoughtWorks is advised of the possibility. In addition, in no event shall ThoughtWorks’ total
                    liability for all damages, losses and causes of action exceed the amount paid by Licensee under the
                    applicable Go Support Schedule. To the extent that liability for death or personal injury caused by
                    its negligence, caused by fraudulent misrepresentation or deceit, or any other liability that may
                    not be excluded or limited by applicable law, ThoughtWorks does not exclude or limit its
                    liability.</p>

                <p>c) The Parties agree that the limitations on and exclusions of liability listed in this Section 6
                    were freely negotiated and are an integral part of the bargain, in that the Product would not have
                    been available for the same price and under the same terms and conditions had such limitations on
                    and exclusions of liability not been included in this Agreement.</p>

                <p>d) To the extent the foregoing warranty disclaimer or limitation of liability is not allowed by
                    applicable law, then the liability of ThoughtWorks, and Licensee’s remedy, shall be limited to, at
                    ThoughtWorks’ option: (i) the re-supply of any defective Product; or (ii) the payment to Licensee of
                    US$50.00 (fifty United States Dollars).</p></li>
            <li>
                <div class="title">INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INDEMNIFICATION</div>
                <p>a) ThoughtWorks will defend or settle, at its expense, any action brought against Licensee based upon
                    the claim that the Product, when used in accordance with this Agreement, knowingly and directly
                    infringes an issued U.S. patent or registered copyright; provided, however, that: (i) Licensee notifies
                    ThoughtWorks promptly in writing of any such claim; (ii) Licensee does not enter into any settlement related to
                    any claim without ThoughtWorks' prior written consent; (iii) ThoughtWorks has sole control of any claim and all
                    related settlement negotiations; and (iv) as requested, Licensee provides ThoughtWorks with all
                    information and assistance necessary to settle or defend the claim.</p>

                <p>(b) If the Product becomes, or may, in the opinion of ThoughtWorks, become the subject of a claim of
                    infringement of any third party intellectual property right, ThoughtWorks may, at its option, and as
                    Licensee’s exclusive remedy: (i) procure the right for Licensee to use the Product; (ii) replace or
                    modify the Product to make it non-infringing; or (iii) make a payment to Licensee of US$50.00 (fifty
                    United States Dollars).</p>

                <p>(c) Licensee will defend or settle, at Licensee’s expense, any action brought against ThoughtWorks
                    based upon the claim that any modifications Licensee makes to the Product or any combination of the
                    Product with software or other items not approved by ThoughtWorks infringes or violates any third party
                    intellectual property right; provided, however, that ThoughtWorks comply with the same requirements outlined in
                    subsections (i)-(iv) of Subparagraph (a).</p>

                <p>(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, ThoughtWorks shall have no obligation to defend
                    Licensee or to pay Licensee’s costs, damages or attorney’s fees, or have any liability whatsoever,
                    for any claim resulting from or attributable to any modifications to the Product or any combination of the
                    Product with other with products or other items not approved by ThoughtWorks or any failure to implement an
                    update to the Product or if Licensee is otherwise not using the Product in accordance with this
                    Agreement.</p></li>

            <li>
                <div class="title">BREACH, CURE, AND TERMINATION OF THE AGREEMENT</div>
                <p>ThoughtWorks can terminate this Agreement in the event of breach by Licensee. Breach by Licensee
                    includes: 1) the failure to prevent unauthorized use or distribution of the Product; 2) accessing, using,
                    modifying, or distributing Third-Party Software independently of the Product and without permission; 3)
                    nonpayment, or 4) any other activity that violates this Agreement. ThoughtWorks may terminate this Agreement
                    immediately upon giving notice to Licensee if after giving Licensee written notice that it is in breach of the
                    Agreement, Licensee fails to cure the breach within seven (7) days of receipt of the notice; except
                    that in the case of Licensee’s failure to pay Support Fees or comply with Section 2, ThoughtWorks reserves
                    the right to terminate this Agreement immediately and without notice or opportunity to cure. In the event of
                    termination of this Agreement: a) all outstanding License Fees and any other amounts owed by
                    Licensee are immediately due and payable; and b) all license rights (including without limitation the perpetual
                    license) granted to Licensee under this Agreement and in relation to the Product are revoked and the Licensee
                    must destroy all copies of the Product. If Licensee terminates the applicable Go Support Schedule, then
                    this Agreement shall automatically terminate.</p></li>

            <li>
                <div class="title">EXPORT</div>
                <p>Licensee acknowledges that this Product may be subject to export controls or restrictions by the
                    United States or other countries or territories and Licensee hereby certifies that Licensee is not located
                    in Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, or Syria. Additionally, Licensee affirms that, to Licensee’s knowledge,
                    Licensee is not included on any list that would cause ThoughtWorks' provision of this Product to Licensee to
                    be prohibited by the laws or regulations of the United States, including the Department of Commerce’s

                    the U.S. Department of Treasury’s lists of Specially Designated Nationals, Specially Designated Narcotics
                    Traffickers, or Specially Designated Terrorists. Licensee agrees to comply with all applicable
                    export and re-export control laws and regulations, including the Export Administration Regulations ("EAR")
                    maintained by the U.S. Department of Commerce.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <div class="title">ASSIGNMENT</div>
                <p>Licensee may not assign its rights under this Agreement except in the case of a change in control of
                    Licensee, including merger or sale. Licensee must give ThoughtWorks 60 days written notice of any
                    such assignment. ThoughtWorks may assign its rights and obligations under this agreement for any reason
                    and without the consent of Licensee.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <div class="title">SEVERABILITY</div>
                <p>Each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such a manner as to be effective and valid
                    under applicable law. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall in no
                    way affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision hereof. Any invalid or unenforceable provision
                    shall be deemed severed from this Agreement and the balance of this Agreement shall be construed and
                    enforced as if this Agreement did not contain the particular provisions(s) held to be invalid or unenforceable
                    and so as to effect the original intent of the parties hereto.</p>
            </li>

                <p>This Agreement shall be deemed executed in the State of Delaware, U.S.A., and shall be governed by

                    conflict of law principles. For purposes of enforcement of arbitration awards, equitable relief, or if for
                    any other reason litigation is permissible under this agreement, each party hereby irrevocably agrees to the
                    exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of any court located in the State of Delaware.</p></li>

            <li>
                <div class="title">NO WAIVER</div>
                <p>No failure or delay by either party in exercising any right, power, or privilege granted under this
                    Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof
                    preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any right, power or privilege granted under
                    this Agreement. The knowing waiver of a Breach of this Agreement or the failure of a party to exercise
                    any right under this Agreement shall in no event constitute a waiver as to any other breach, whether similar
                    or dissimilar in nature, or prevent the exercise of any right under this Agreement.</p>
