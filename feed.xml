    <content type="html">In this post, we will show you how to use a manual approval process to propagate your build which is especially useful for critical deployments. It not only gives you more control, but also prevents human error in complex pipelines thereby making your deployments safer.</content>

    <content type="html">There has been increasing interest in defining builds and pipelines as code. We see a rise in the assumption that defining pipelines as code requires the use of a full programming language. This post will  break down how we got to build and pipelines as code and challenge some of the assumptions.</content>

    <content type="html">The path from commit to production involves numerous moving parts, (like multiple code and asset repositories, automatic and manual handoffs, unit tests, integration tests, acceptance tests, performance tests, security tests, etc.) and time that it takes to execute all of these elements. You need a way of modeling your workflow so that people can see, understand and talk about it. This is where CD pipelines come in.</content>
