The Go team has created a VirtualBox VM image to help people interested in development go get started quickly. This short video
shows the process of downloading and setting up the virtual machine. 

The Vagrant box and Vagrantfile can be found at https://github.com/gocd/documentation/blob/master/3/3.1.md

Please note: You _must_ have <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> 1.4.3+ and <a href=https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> 4.3.6+ installed to use this environment.
