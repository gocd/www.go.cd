          <p>
            In the GoCD ecosystem, the server is the one that controls everything. It provides the user interface to users
            of the system and provides work for the agents to do. The agents are the ones that do any work (run commands,
            do deployments, etc) that is configured by the users or administrators of the system.
          </p>
          <p>
            The server does not do any user-specified "work" on its own. It will not run any commands or do
            deployments. That is the reason you need a GoCD Server and at least one GoCD Agent installed before you
            proceed.

          Once you have them installed and running, you should see a screen similar to this, if you navigate to the home

          Congratulations! You're on your way to using GoCD. If you now click "Pipelines", you'll get back to the "Add

        <h2 class="big-title"><a name="creating_pipeline"></a>Creating a pipeline</h2>
        <p>Before creating a pipeline, it might help to know what it is and concepts around it.</p>

        <section class="concept" id="concept2">
          <h3><a name="concept_pipelines_and_materials"></a>Concept 2: Pipelines and materials</h3>
          <figure>
            <img src="../../assets/images/getting-started/part-1/gocd-pipelines-materials-2018-3a418409.svg" title="GoCD Concept 2 - Pipelines and Materials" alt="Multiple materials mapped to a Pipeline with multiple stages within it" />
          </figure>
          <p>
            A pipeline, in GoCD, is a representation of workflow or a part of a workflow. For instance, if you are trying
            to automatically run tests, build an installer and then deploy an application to a test environment, then
            those steps can be modeled as a pipeline. GoCD provides different modeling constructs within a pipeline, such
            as stages, jobs and tasks. We will see these in more detail soon. For the purpose of this part of the guide,
            you need to know that a pipeline can be configured to run a command or set of commands.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another equally important concept is that of a material. A material is a cause for a pipeline to "trigger" or
            to start doing what it is configured to do. Typically, a material is a source control repository (like Git,
            Subversion, etc) and any new commit to the repository is a cause for the pipeline to trigger. A pipeline needs
            to have at least one material and can have as many materials of different kinds as you want.
          </p>
          <p>
            The concept of a pipeline is extremely central to Continuous Delivery. Together with the concepts of stages,
            jobs and tasks, GoCD provides important modeling blocks which allow you to build up very complex workflows,
            and get feedback quicker. You'll learn more about GoCD pipelines and Deployment pipelines in the upcoming
            parts of this guide. In case you cannot wait, Martin Fowler has a nice and succinct
            article <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DeploymentPipeline.html">here</a>.
          </p>
        </section>

        <p>
          Now, back at the "Add pipeline" screen, let's provide the pipeline a name, without spaces, and ignore the "Pipeline Group" field for now.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="../../assets/images/getting-started/part-1/3-step-1-a772fe86.png" title="Step 1: Name your pipeline" alt="Step 1 - Screen to name your pipeline" />
          <figcaption>Step 1: Name our pipeline</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Pressing "Next" will take you to step 2, which can be used to configure a material.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="../../assets/images/getting-started/part-1/4-step-2a-9f39d601.png" title="Step 2a: Point it to a material - Where to look for changes?" alt="Step 2 A - Screen to choose a material" />
          <figcaption>Step 2a: Point it to a material - Where to look for changes?</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          You can choose your own material here <sup><a href="#fn1" id="r1">[1]</a></sup>, or use a Git repository
          available on GitHub for this guide. The URL of that repository
          is: <span class="nobreak"><a href="https://github.com/gocd-contrib/getting-started-repo.git">https://github.com/gocd-contrib/getting-started-repo.git</a></span>. You
          can change "Material Type" to "Git" and provide the URL in the "URL" textbox. If you now click on the "Check
          Connection" button, it should tell you everything is OK.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="../../assets/images/getting-started/part-1/5-step-2b-a50afb00.png" title="Step 2b: Check that the material exists" alt="Step 2 B - Checking that the material exists" />
          <figcaption>Step 2b: Check that the material exists</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          This step assumes that you have git installed on the GoCD Server and Agent. Like git, any other commands you
          need for running your scripts need to be installed on the GoCD Agent nodes.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you had trouble with this step, and it failed, take a look at the
          <a href="https://docs.gocd.org/current/installation/troubleshoot_installer.html">troubleshooting page</a> in the
          documentation. If everything went well, press "Next" to be taken to step 3, which deals with stages, jobs and
          tasks.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="../../assets/images/getting-started/part-1/6-step-3a-7189499d.png" title="Step 3a: Use the predefined stage and job" alt="Step 3 A - Use the predefined stage and job" />
          <figcaption>Step 3a: Use the predefined stage and job for now</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Since a stage name and a job name are populated, and in the interest of quickly achieving our goal of creating
          and running a pipeline in GoCD, let us delay understanding the (admittedly very important) concepts of stage and
          job and focus on a task instead. Scrolling down a bit, you'll see the "Initial Job and Task"
          section.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="../../assets/images/getting-started/part-1/7-step-3b-9bcde35c.png" title="Step 3b: Take a closer look at the initial job and task" alt="Step 3 B - Take a closer look at the initial job and task" />
          <figcaption>Step 3b: Take a closer look at the initial job and task</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Since we don't want to use "Ant" right now, let's change the "Task Type" to "More...". You should see a screen
          like this:
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="../../assets/images/getting-started/part-1/8-step-3c-1bfdef0f.png" title="Step 3c: Choose a custom command" alt="Step 3 C - Choose a custom command" />
          <figcaption>Step 3c: Choose a custom command</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Change the text of the "Command" text box to "./build" (that is, dot forward-slash build) and press
          "Finish". If all went well, you just created your first pipeline! Leaving you in a screen similar to the one
          shown below.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="../../assets/images/getting-started/part-1/9-pipeline-paused-0facb989.png" title="Your first pipeline (paused)" alt="Your first pipeline (paused)" />
          <figcaption>Your first pipeline (paused)</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Helpfully, the pipeline has been paused for you (see the pause button and the text next to it, right next to
          the pipeline name). This allows you to make more changes to the pipeline before it triggers. Usually, pipeline
          administrators can take this opportunity to add more stages, jobs, etc. and model their pipelines better. For
          the purpose of this guide, let's just un-pause this pipeline and get it to run. Click on the blue "pause"
          button and then click on the "Pipelines" link in the header.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you give it a minute, you'll see your pipeline building (yellow) and then finish successfully (green):
        </p>

        <p>and then clicking on the job will take you to the actual task and show you what it did:</p>

        <p>
          Scrolling up a bit, you can see it print out the environment variables for the task and the details of the agent
          this task ran on (remember <a href="#concept1">"Concept 1"</a>?).
        </p>

        <div class="concept" id="concept3">
          <h3><a name="concept_agent_does_work"></a>Concept 3: Agent prepares to do some work</h3>
          <p>
            Did you notice the lines at the top of the build which said: "Start updating files at revision ..."? This is the agent
            preparing to run the job configured. Every material configured for that pipeline will be updated to the correct
            revision, so that it is consistent with the rest of the pipeline and the system as a whole.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once the material is checked out (if it is the first time it is ever used) and updated to the correct revision, it will
            be available for use in a task. That is the reason the build script, "./build" was available without you having to do
            anything. It is found inside the configured <a
            href="https://github.com/gocd-contrib/getting-started-repo/blob/ea5d1406aa6408c2fb920965d1c0e3e8564db14f/build">Git
            repository material</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this case, we had only one material, and so we could use it as "./build". If you had configured more materials, you'd
            need to provide a working directory for each material and would have had to use the script as "./material1/build" (for
            instance).
          </p>
          <p>
            Notice that the GoCD Agent independently checks out the repository, meaning that the version control systems of your
            materials (Git, SVN, etc) need to be available on the GoCD Agent as well.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p>
          Now that you have a basic idea of a pipeline and what it does, let's understand more about its components.
        </p>

        <section class="concept" id="concept4">
          <h3><a name="concept_stages_jobs_tasks"></a>Concept 4: Stages, jobs and tasks</h3>
          <figure>
            <img src="../../assets/images/getting-started/part-1/gocd-stage-jobs-tasks-2018-5399c80d.svg" title="GoCD Concept 4 - Stages, jobs and tasks" alt="GoCD Pipeline with multiple stages within running multiple jobs each" />
          </figure>

          <p>
            A pipeline consists of one or more "stages", each stage consists of one or more "jobs" and each job is made up of one or
            more "tasks". All of these are modeling constructs within a pipeline. Starting from the smallest piece:
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt>Task</dt>
            <dd>
              A task is typically a command which is configured to run as a part of the job it is in. Not every task needs
              to be a simple command, since tasks can be plugins. In this guide, the "./build" that was configured to run
              was a task. GoCD has Ant, NAnt and Rake tasks as built-in tasks, but has many more optional plugins which can
              be installed. The most versatile built-in task is the one that was used in this guide, which is the "Custom
              Command". Whenever anyone asks the question, "Can GoCD run &lt;application-x&gt;?, the answer is always "Yes",
              because it can always be executed as a custom command.

          </dl>
          <dl>
            <dt>Job</dt>
            <dd>
              A job is a sequential collection of tasks. Each task in a job is run one after the other, and in its default
              configuration, if a task fails, none of the tasks following that one get executed. The job is then considered to have
              "failed". The most important aspect of a job is that a <em>single</em> agent has to pick up and finish a job. So, you can be
              guaranteed that all tasks in a job run on the <em>same</em> agent.
            </dd>
          </dl>
          <dl>
            <dt>Stage</dt>
            <dd>
              A stage is a collection of jobs, but the jobs are not sequential. They can be picked up in any order and so, they
              have to be <em>independent</em> of each other. This crucial distinction between how a job is composed of its tasks (sequential)
              and how a stage is composed of its jobs (non-sequential) is what provides built-in parallelizability in GoCD. Since jobs
              in a stage are independent of each other, they will all be started together, when a stage starts. Assuming that you have
              enough agents started and not busy, then every job in a stage can run on a different agent at the same time, potentially
              speeding up your build by a lot.

            Circling back to the pipeline we created in this guide: The pipeline had one stage called "defaultStage" and one job in
            that stage called "defaultJob" and had only one task in that - a custom command task, which ran: "./build".

          This is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of GoCD's features and capabilities. In the upcoming parts of this guide,
          you will learn more about some more of GoCD's core features, such as fan-in, fan-out, artifact promotion, pipeline
          dependencies, value stream maps and more.

            If you're used to using Git or any version control system used by GoCD, you can clone your repository locally and
            provide that path instead of using the repository on GitHub used in this guide. That way, you can make commits to
            your repository and see pipelines triggering because of them.
