These have been manually copied here from inside font-awesome-sass as the asset pipeline seems to have problems
and is not leading to sprockets/middleman including the fonts in the assets despite them being referenced from sass/scss.

Theoretically, should be updated manually when font-awesome-sass is updated, but probably not super important given we
have been on old fonts for years.

This was basically done to upgrade middleman and other libraries to help us stay with modern Ruby versions.
