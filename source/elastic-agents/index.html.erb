            <p class="main-desc">Agents are the workers in the GoCD ecosystem. Rather than having dedicated idle agents
              at all times, elastic agents allow you to scale up, with on-demand agents, based on the need of the task
              being executed. This saves you both time and costs.</p>

          <h4>Great reasons to use GoCD’s Elastic Agent feature:</h4>

          <p>If you’re a GoCD user: <br/>
            We have a whole bunch of plugins for you to use Elastic Agents. If you're running builds on OpenStack,
            Docker, Docker Swarm or AWS, we've got you covered. Get started by installing the plugins and start saving!
          </p>

          <p>If you want to build your own plugin: <br/>
            You can also start building your own elastic agent plugins by forking the skeleton plugin and looking at a
            <a href="https://github.com/gocd-contrib/docker-elastic-agents"> sample docker plugin </a> as an example
            reference implementation.
          </p>
