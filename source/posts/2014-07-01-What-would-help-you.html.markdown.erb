One of my personal favorite things about open source software is the ability to get involved. Sometimes the changes made are small, and sometimes they aren't. I've found that this is reasonably easy on small or new projects, and considerably harder on larger or more mature projects. 

GoCD is large and mature.

The existing GoCD team has done a few things to try to make it easier for you to get involved...

* [Vagrant and VirtualBox based dev environment](https://github.com/gocd/go-development-environment-setup)
* [Constantly growing documentation](https://github.com/gocd/documentation)
* [Mailing lists to help out and answer questions](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/go-cd)
* [Contribution Guide](https://www.gocd.org/contribute/contribution-guide.html)

Are these helpful to you? What would be more helpful?

Keep in mind that involvement in an open source project doesn't imply writing code. Submitted code is great. Documentation, discussion and even evangelism are incredibly valuable as well. 

Feel free to use the discussion forums below or use the mailing lists to discuss.
