## What is Continuous Delivery 101?

This is a video series to help you get started on your CD journey. Ken Mugrage, a notable advocate for continuous delivery, will walk you through a collection of 5 short videos. This series will cover the history of CD, basic concepts, best practices, how to get started and popular tools. We will also introduce in-depth readings as we go through these basic concepts with you.

By the end of the video series, you'll have a holistic view of continuous delivery and a deeper understanding and appreciation of critical concepts.

## Why should you watch it?

These videos can help you and more specifically, your team, learn to adopt best practices of Continuous Delivery, understand the core concepts of a deployment pipeline, and the history of how Agile and Lean drove these technical practices.

You can truly benefit out of these videos if you:

- are championing DevOps transformation in your organization and need a concise 'getting started' guide for your team
- think your team are doing continuous delivery but not quite there yet and want to take as step back to refresh the fundamentals
