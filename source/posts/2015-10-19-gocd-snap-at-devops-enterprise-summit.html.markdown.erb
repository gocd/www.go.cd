SAN FRANCISCO, CA -- GoCD and Snap CI, products of ThoughtWorks, will join other software thought leaders in co-sponsoring the 2015 DevOps Enterprise Summit.

Taking place October 19-21, 2015 at the Hyatt Regency Hotel in San Francisco, the DevOps Enterprise Summit is the industry's leading
DevOps and Continuous Delivery event. DOES15 is the event dedicated to those bringing Lean principles into the IT value stream while building
DevOps and Continuous Delivery into their organization.

<blockquote>
"ThoughtWorks has been at the forefront of Continuous Delivery adoption since 2010 when former ThoughtWorkers Jez Humble and David
Farley published the first book on Continuous Delivery," said Technical Evangelist Ken Mugrage. "Both GoCD and Snap CI continue that
spirit of innovation in their product design, always creating new and improved ways for customers to make their releases more reliable and
more frequent."
</blockquote>

Currently, ThoughtWorks offers both on-premise and cloud-based Continuous Delivery solutions. GoCD is free, open-source and
specializes in advanced deployments. Snap CI is cloud-based, taking hardware out of the equation while offering a reliable feedback
loop. Deployment pipelines are at the core of both products and offer visibility to the entire team.
