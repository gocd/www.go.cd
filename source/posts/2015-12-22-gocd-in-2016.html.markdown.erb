GoCD 15.3 has been released! I think now is a great time to talk about GoCD in
2016. In a way, a lot of work in 2015 was setup towards enabling more
improvements in 2016. There was some "debt" that needed paying off, some
performance improvements that needed to be made, some APIs that needed to be
standardized and improved and more. All of it was valuable, in my opinion, and
were necessary to do a lot more exciting work!

This is what the high-level idea for GoCD in 2016 looks like:

* Be universal and easily extensible through usable extension points (both APIs and plugins)
* Produce more content around how GoCD can be used effectively and even how your CD journey can be more effective
* Have a better getting-started experience both in the application itself and on [gocd.org](https://gocd.org)
* Better support for clouds and containers

Let's take a look at each of these areas and what kind of changes can be expected in the GoCD ecosystem for it, in 2016:

## Be universal and easily extensible

For a while now, GoCD has been introducing new extension points to make new
[plugins](https://www.gocd.org/community/plugins.html) possible. In 2015, the
material endpoint was introduced to enable GoCD to use newer kinds of
materials. This led to plugins which trigger builds on GitHub pull requests, Git
feature branches, Gerrit change sets and some plugins which have not been
open-sourced by the authoring organizations yet. Similarly, the notification
endpoint allowed, among other plugins, notifiers for Slack, HipChat, Gerrit,
Websockets, etc.

In 2016, this trend should continue with a more comprehensive notification
endpoint which includes events related to agents registering and going missing,
jobs and pipelines starting and finishing, config changes, user actions, logins
and more. This should allow users and tool authors to write better dashboards,
generate better information out of GoCD and integrate it better with external
tools.

Adding to this, the [elastic agent
endpoint](https://arvindsv.github.io/elastic_agents_for_gocd.html), the plan for
which is to start work in the new year, should enable quite interesting
integrations and make GoCD more effective on clouds and containers. More on this
below!

Finally, the [APIs](https://api.gocd.org) in GoCD are continuously improving and are being
extended. This will continue in 2016, and enable better integrations and UX. The
idea is to continue to be API-first and any change to GoCD itself involves a
re-think of the API surrounding it and often, work is done on the API and it is
improved before the actual change is made.

## Produce more content around GoCD and CD itself

Though there is some growing content around how CD ("Continuous Delivery")
works, it is hard to find good guides around a lot of concepts and practices
around it. It's definitely hard to find it in one place. The closest is probably
the excellent book, [Continuous Delivery](https://continuousdelivery.com/),
co-authored by Jez Humble and Dave Farley. However, there's definitely room for
more content, including recent experience reports and learnings. I'd like us to
start this with some ideas and posts, but <em>this is something with which you,
wonderful reader, can help</em>. Guest posts or even edits and comments will always
be useful. This need not be content generated solely by this community. I feel
that it should link out to good external references as needed and be a good
place for everyone to learn more about CD in general and improve their
craft. Look out for more of this in 2016!


## Have a better getting-started experience

GoCD's getting started experience can definitely be better. As with everything
these days, users' expectations regarding their initial and continued
experiences keeps changing. In GoCD's world, I think one of the problems is that
the domain of GoCD's
[concepts](https://docs.gocd.org/current/introduction/concepts_in_go.html)
takes getting used to. Other problems include a not-so-easy installation and
evaluation experience, better documentation targeted towards a new user ("How do
I create my first pipeline?"), better dashboard UI, a much better
[gocd.org](https://gocd.org) site which points to all this information in a meaningful
way, etc.

In 2016, GoCD and the ecosystem around it should change to make this possible
and though changing everything in the application is probably a multi-year
effort, the already-mentioned changes to the API have been making this easier to
do, since the frontend and the backend are more clearly separated. If you have
good UI/UX skills and are willing to help, just join us on the [developers'
Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/gocd/gocd) and let us know!


## Better support for clouds and containers

Though this comes up last in this list, it is definitely not the least
important. In fact, the current plan is to start on this very soon. The cloud
and container ecosystems (who am I kidding, no one seems to be able to look
beyond "docker") have been exploding over the last couple of years (at least)
and there is a definite trend of interest and move towards both of them and
beyond them. As a CD system, I feel that GoCD can definitely help users make use
of their investments in clouds and containers more effective, when used for CD.

Elastic agents have been mentioned earlier in this document. In 2016, the idea
is to use elastic agents and create a docker-container-per-job plugin, which
runs a fully isolated job with dependency management done inside the docker
image rather than the GoCD agent ("You need Maven 3.0? Sure. Update your
Dockerfile and it will be taken care of. You won't cause issues with this other
pipeline which needs Maven 2.0."). With elastic agents, this can be done
transparently and a GoCD agent can be brought up inside a container temporarily
and a build can be executed and the agent torn down and thrown away. To make
this work really well will involve some exciting changes to the GoCD Agent
infrastructure, like moving away from a pure Java agent to a language-agnostic
one (umm, I'm going to go for full buzz points and say, "golang") and pure JSON
communication between the agent and the server. Though Docker is the one with
the most interest from everyone, there are many other competing container
ecosystems and the fact that the elastic agent endpoint is open and usable by
anyone will help plugin authors do this for other ecosystems, if there is
interest.

GoCD also needs to be more easily usable in cloud ecosystems. First of all that
means making it more easy to evaluate it on different cloud offerings. Second,
it means having the ability to spin up agents on different cloud offerings and
have them connect to the server. Though this is possible today, and is used by
some users of GoCD, there is a perception that it cannot be done. I think this
scenario should be explicitly thought about and there should be enough content
and related infrastructure provided to make it easy for anyone to run their CD
system in the cloud. Again, with elastic agents, they can be brought up and down
on demand and can be really cost-effective.

For Thoughtworks' [supported offering](https://thoughtworks.com/go), the idea is
to pick a cloud provider (most likely AWS, as it is an obvious choice for many)
and provide deeper integration with it, along with the ability to have fully
elastic agents. Similarly, there is a vast ecosystem around containers to work
with, and it is likely that there will be much deeper integration with
Kubernetes or Mesos and maybe more. I am excited about the potential of this to
change how organizations think about their builds, repeatability of builds and
isolation. All topics that interest me and many on the GoCD team as well.


## What else?

There is some work from 2015 that will need to be wrapped up: the new config UI
for one, getting Tomasz' [config
changes](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/1133) merged in, some API endpoints
and smaller changes. But, apart from that, I'd like the core GoCD team to focus
on what is in this document. Though this is different from 2015 where we asked
the community to help choose ideas, I feel that it is worth trying to set a
direction and work towards it rather than try and design by committee.

There is always room for feedback and I'm not averse to changing this as it is
not set in stone. However, I would like to be convinced for the need to change
this. :) If you really feel strongly about something which is not on this and
you think it should be fixed, you're always welcome to work on it and submit a
pull request and the team has been responsive to them. In fact, the feeling of
knowing that someone else cares enough to take the effort to understand the code
and submit a pull request is ... something else. We love it!

We have had some wonderful contributors in 2015, and I hope they continue in
2016 and beyond and I hope we continue to get new contributors interested in
making GoCD even better.

You will also see many more releases in 2016 than earlier. The plan is to not
tie releases to features and either release on a date or maybe even every green
regression build. The team and I feel that the groundwork to do this will be
valuable and it will be useful to the many users who are looking to get the
latest and greatest more often, and provide quicker feedback.


## Summary

Lots of exciting changes coming up: APIs, endpoints, clouds, containers, Docker,
better content, getting started, UI and UX changes ... and more. It's going to be
a great year!

<small>Please pardon the verbosity of this post. A better one with pictures and better
communication might be on its way soon. :) I just wanted the information out here
earlier than later.</small>
