If you've never setup GoCD or used it at all, you should definitely start from our [Help page](https://gocd.org/help), to get you started. 

## GoCD User Documentation

There are a couple sections of the user documentation that can be especially helpful to people new to GoCD.

* [Setting up a new Pipeline](https://www.gocd.org/getting-started/part-1) - See how to set up your first pipeline
* [Concepts in GoCD](https://docs.gocd.org/current/introduction/concepts_in_go.html) - This covers some of the basic concepts used in GoCD. A good understanding of what Pipelines, Stages, Jobs and Tasks are will be very helpful.
* [Managing Agents](https://docs.gocd.org/current/configuration/managing_a_build_cloud.html) - The GoCD server produces the user interface for GoCD, but it doesn't actually run your jobs. Learn how to use GoCD Agents to "do the work".

## Community

* [The GoCD mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/go-cd) - A great place to search for answers to questions you may have, or of course ask them if they aren't already covered.

## Live Demonstrations

* [Webinars](https://gocd.org/events) - Thoughtworks presents live webinars every two weeks so that you can see GoCD in action. There are also recordings of previous webinars on our blog.

## Professional Support

* [Thoughtworks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/go) - The first 30 days of professional support
provided by Thoughtworks is free. You'll get access to a global support team, and tough issues can be escalated directly to the GoCD development team.

## Alternative Installation

* [Docker Container](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/gocd/gocd-server/) - This is an easy way to see what GoCD does. As it
says in the description, this is not a production container. You'll also need at least one instance of the [agent container](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/gocd/gocd-agent/)

* [Chef Partner Cookbook](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/gocd) - You can get started on GoCD with your Chef configurations quickly with our official partner cookbook. This cookbook will help you setup Go servers and agents in a fully automated way.
