Some things to be aware of when using Windows PowerShell tasks.

### GoCD Agent default installation

The [default](https://docs.gocd.org/current/installation/installing_go_agent.html) installation of a GoCD
agent will use a 32-bit JRE unless you indicate otherwise. This JRE is embedded in the GoCD agent installer.

If you want to use an alternative JRE (must satisfy GoCD's JRE requirements) after the initial installation, you can alter
the "wrapper.java.command" key's value in the ```[InstallDirectory]\config\wrapper-agent.conf``` file  to point to a
different JRE. You will then need to restart the GoCD agent service to start using the alternative JRE.

The ```[InstallDirectory]``` refers to the GoCD agents installation directory which by default is ```"C:\Program Files (x86)\Go Agent"```.


### Pre-requisites for running PowerShell task commands

- You can only run on Windows based agents
- You should tag the agents if your are also using linux agents
- You probably want to ensure your agents all have the same version of PowerShell

#### 32-bit GoCD agent

If you are running a default GoCD agent installation then you will be running a 32-bit JRE.

The 32-bit JRE will try to run PowerShell tasks in the 32-bit version of PowerShell, even if you give the full path to
the 64-bit PowerShell executable in the task. If you need to execute a PowerShell script then you will need to alter the
execution policy as follows:

- Open 32-bit version of PowerShell as an administrator: Start -> All Programs -> Accessories -> Windows Powershell -> Windows Powershell (x86) and type:

      # Alter execution policy
      set-executionpolicy remotesigned -force

This will allow you to run local scripts on the Windows GoCD agent box.

#### 64-bit GoCD agent

If you are running a GoCD agent using a 64-bit JRE, it will run PowerShell tasks in the 64-bit version of PowerShell.

If you need to execute a PowerShell script, then you will need to alter the execution policy as follows:

- Open 64-bit version of PowerShell as an administrator: Start -> All Programs -> Accessories -> Windows Powershell ->
  Windows Powershell and type:

      # Alter execution policy
      set-executionpolicy remotesigned -force

This will allow you to run local scripts on the Windows GoCD agent box.


### PowerShell task commands

You can configure the task as follows:

    command: powershell
    arg: .\run.ps1 arg1value

This assumes that the ```run.ps1``` script is in the task's working directory.

If you create the ```run.ps1``` file with the following content you can see details of the execution context in the console log for the pipeline:

    param
    (
      [string] $arg1
    )
    write-host "Script:            " $MyInvocation.MyCommand.Path
    write-host "Pid:               " $pid
    write-host "Host.Version:      " $host.version
    write-host "Is 64-bit process: " $([Environment]::Is64BitProcess)
    write-host "Execution policy:  " $(get-executionpolicy)
    write-host "Arg1:              " $arg1


### Propagating failures

You need to ensure that PowerShell exits with an exit code that is not 0 in the event of a failure, this needs to cater to:

  - Script errors
  - External process calls that indicate failure

You will need to decide how to handle these failures and if they should indicate the PowerShell task has been successful
or not. This may mean that some script errors and external process calls failing is okay in your context.

The following script demonstrates a strategy I use where I exit with a non zero code if any script error was encountered
or an external process call fails:

    set-strictmode -version latest
    $ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'

    function execute-externaltool
    (
      [string] $context,
      [scriptblock] $actionBlock
    )
    {
      # This function exists to check the exit code for the external tool called within the script block, so we don't have to do this for each call
      & $actionBlock
      if ($LastExitCode -gt 0) { throw "$context : External tool call failed" }
    }


    try
    {
      write-host "Script:            " $MyInvocation.MyCommand.Path
      write-host "Pid:               " $pid
      write-host "Host.Version:      " $host.version
      write-host "Execution policy:  " $(get-executionpolicy)

      # Query a service that does not exist, sc.exe will return with a non 0 exit code
      execute-externaltool "Query a non existent service, will return with exit code != 0" { c:\windows\system32\sc.exe query service_does_not_exist }
    }
    catch
    {
      write-host "$pid : Error caught - $_"
      if ($? -and (test-path variable:LastExitCode) -and ($LastExitCode -gt 0)) { exit $LastExitCode }
      else { exit 1 }
    }

- This script uses a try catch block to handle all errors
	- The $? and $LastExitCode caters to both script and external process calls
	- We fall back on an exit code of 1 if we do not have an external process exit code
- This script uses an execute-externaltool function which takes a script block argument
	- The script will invoke the script block
	- It will then check for a non zero exit code (Assumes the script block just calls an external process), if so it will throw an exception.
