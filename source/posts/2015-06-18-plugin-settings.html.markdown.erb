GoCD is continuously improving its plugin infrastructure. Starting 15.2.0 GoCD will support "Plugin Settings" that will allow plugins developers to accept global settings. Currently these configurations had to be supported via system properties or a file that is in specified format in a specified location, which makes it a little haphazard. With this feature *all* plugins will have one approach to accept plugins settings from user & access plugin settings from GoCD Server.

### How does it work?

* On plugin listing page users will see a gear icon (similar to one on the pipeline dashboard) for the plugins that accept plugin settings.

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/blog/plugin-settings/list-plugin.png" class="has_border full_size"
    id="plugin_listing" title="Plugin listing with gear icon" alt="Plugin listing with gear icon" />
  <figcaption>Figure 1: Plugin listing with gear icon <span class="click_to_enlarge">(Click to enlarge)</span></figcaption>
</figure>

* Clicking on the gear icon opens a pop-up that renders "Plugin Settings" template that is provided by the plugin.

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/blog/plugin-settings/configure-plugin.png" class="has_border full_size"
    id="configure_plugin" title="Configure plugin pop-up" alt="Configure plugin pop-up" />
  <figcaption>Figure 2: Configure plugin pop-up <span class="click_to_enlarge">(Click to enlarge)</span></figcaption>
</figure>

* On "Save" the user inputs are validated by plugin.

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/blog/plugin-settings/configure-plugin-errors.png" class="has_border full_size"
    id="configure_plugin_errors" title="Configure plugin pop-up with errors" alt="Configure plugin pop-up with errors" />
  <figcaption>Figure 3: Configure plugin pop-up with errors <span class="click_to_enlarge">(Click to enlarge)</span></figcaption>
</figure>

We hope plugin developers are able to use this feature to provide a better experience to their users.
