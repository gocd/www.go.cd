Today we released Go 14.1. 

### New Feature

#### Create your own task plugins for Go.

Go supports configuring a few kinds of tasks (Nant, Ant and Rake), directly, from the configuration UI, without specifying them as a custom command. For instance, if you go to the configuration UI for a job, you'll see something like this:

A task plugin allows you to extend this so that you can have other tasks available here. The plugin also allows you to control the UI, as well as the data stored for this task.

For instance, you can find the source of a sample Curl plugin in Go's updated help documents. Assuming you have the plugin installed, you'll see that the dropdown in the job configuration UI has changed to look like this:

	To use the new plugin related features of Go, it is required that you upgrade the agent-bootstrapper with version < 12.3. Although agent-bootstrapper version >= 12.3 is capable of handling this feature, we recommend upgrading your go-server and go-agents to the latest release. You can read more about this <a href="/2014/04/24/agent-bootstrapper-upgrade-for-plugins.html">here</a>.
