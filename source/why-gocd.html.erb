          <p>
            With its parallel and sequential execution, GoCD can easily configure dependencies for fast feedback and
            on-demand deployment. Its fan-in/fan-out dependency management always does the "right thing," avoiding
            spurious builds.

          <p>
            Every pipeline instance is anchored to a particular changeset. GoCD makes it easy to pass once-built
            binaries between stages so you know exactly what's being deployed and that the binary has been tested.

          <p>
            GoCD's real power is in the visibility it provides over your end-to-end workflow. GoCD's Value Stream Map
            lets you track a change from commit to deploy at a glance. And when things go wrong, it's easy to see both
            the upstream cause and the downstream effects.

          <h2 class="features__title">Deploy any version, any time</h2>
          <p>
            GoCD's manual triggers allow you to deploy any known good version of your application to wherever you
            like. This increases reliability of pushing to production, and empowers QA teams with self-service
            environments. And, if necessary, it's securable and auditable.

          <p>
            Verification is a key piece of any deployment pipeline. GoCD will execute tests written in most languages or
            frameworks. GoCD's agent grid provides parallel and cross-platform execution. GoCD's test reporting will tell
            you in exactly which changeset and on which platform a test started breaking, which comes in extremely handy
            when fixing a complex broken build.

          <h2 class="features__title">Compare builds</h2>
          <p>
            GoCD's compare builds feature can provide a simple bill of materials for any deployment. Perhaps more
            powerful is its ability to compare the content - both files and commit messages - across any two arbitrary
            builds. This is invaluable when troubleshooting a broken pipeline.

          <h2 class="features__title">Eliminate bottlenecks</h2>
          <p>
            GoCD's agent grid eliminates bottlenecks, providing trivial parallel execution across pipelines, platforms,
            versions, branches, etc.

          <h2 class="features__title">Keep configuration tidy</h2>
          <p>
            Easily reuse pipeline configurations via GoCD's template system. This makes managing pipelines for versions
            and branches easy as pie.

          <p>
            While most enterprise applications go overboard with their permission model, GoCD seeks to provide just
            enough. In particular, GoCD supports auditable deployment and can delegate the configuration of pipelines to
            users without full-blown admin privileges.
