<h4>Role Based Access Control</h4>

Traditionally, a Role in GoCD is a group of users. With this release, we are enhancing the purpose of Roles. Roles can now be used to control the access of different entities in GoCD, which earlier were accessible only by System Administrators.

System Adminstrators can configure permissions for a given role using policies at a granular level. This release adds support to configure access to environments, support for more entities will be added in subsequent releases.

Read the GoCD Policy [documentation](https://docs.gocd.org/19.11.0/configuration/policy_in_gocd.html) for more details.

<h4>UI/UX refresh</h4>
