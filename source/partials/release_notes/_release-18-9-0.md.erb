<h4>Backups on a schedule</h4>

  This release allows performing a backup on schedule. GoCD now allows executing a script once the backup completes. This feature removes the need for GoCD administrators to execute and monitor custom "cron-like" jobs to ensure that backups are completed.

  For example: Users can now add the following snippet to the config XML to perform a backup once a night at 10pm on weekdays and call the `/usr/local/bin/upload-to-s3 script` after the backup is done:

    <server>
      ...
      <backup schedule="0 0 22 ? * MON-FRI" 
              postBackupScript="/usr/local/bin/upload-to-s3"
              emailOnSuccess="false"
              emailOnFailure="true"/>
    </server>

<h4>Analytics Extension V2</h4>

  Upgraded the Analytics Extension to [Version 2](https://plugin-api.gocd.org/18.9.0/analytics). This version adds support for showing analytics on the Agents and Value Stream Map(VSM) page.

<h4>Notification Extension V4</h4>

  [Version 4](https://plugin-api.gocd.org/18.9.0/notifications) of the Notification Extension enchances the existing Stage Status notification message to include the material fingerprint. It also provides details of previous stage(if any) responsible for triggering the current stage.

<h4>Deprecations</h4>

  * The ubuntu 12.04 based docker image for [gocd agent](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-agent-ubuntu-12.04/) has been deprecated and will not be built in the upcoming releases of GoCD. This is done because ubuntu 12.04 is now end-of-life.

   * With the introduction of AES for encryption/decryption in release 18.7.0, we are deprecating support for DES. Support for DES is retained to support DES cipher-texts configured in config-repos and will be available till the last release of GoCD for the year 2018.
