<h4>Secrets Management</h4>

We have enhanced support for managing secrets in GoCD. GoCD now provides an ability to refer to secrets defined in an external Secret Manager. With this, apart from referring to secrets, users can manage permissions for these secrets and rotate them without any changes to GoCD configuration.

Support for Secrets Management is provided using plugins. We have introduced a new secrets extension using which plugin authors can write a plugin to support a Secret Manager of their choice. We have built a File based Secret Management plugin which is bundled along with GoCD.

Please refer to the [Secret Management Documentation](https://docs.gocd.org/19.6.0/configuration/secrets_management.html) for more information.

<h4> GoCD Installer Changes </h4>

There is some variation in how GoCD server and agents across multiple different operating systems and installer types need to be managed by system admins. To reduce the maintenance overhead and cognitive load, all the installers have undergone varying degrees of changes.

<div class="information">
  If you are an existing GoCD user upgrading from an older version of GoCD, please read <a href="https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/6627">about the changes</a> before performing an upgrade. Users installing GoCD for the first time should not be affected.

<h4>Running Dockerized GoCD Containers as Non Root</h4>

Starting from this release, GoCD containers run as non-root user, by default. The Dockerized GoCD application will run as `go:root` (`uid:1000`, `gid:0`) user instead of running as `root:root` (`uid:0`, `gid:0`). For more information, checkout the <%= link_to "Running Dockerized GoCD Containers as Non Root", '/posts/2019-06-25-gocd-non-root-containers.html' %> blog post.


<h4>Simpler HTTP authentication for agent-server communication</h4>

Historically, GoCD agent server communication required SSL/TLS mutual authentication using X509 certificates. GoCD version 19.6 disables mutual TLS by default. This will allow GoCD administrators to terminate agent-server communication at load balancers or reverse proxies.

To turn on the old behavior and enable mutual TLS, set the environment variable `GO_USE_TOKEN_AUTH` to `false`.

<ul>
  <li>Java 8 (Deprecated)</li>
