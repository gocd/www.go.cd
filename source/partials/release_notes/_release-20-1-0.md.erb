<h4>Improvements to Role Based Access Control</h4>

As part of GoCD release `v19.11.0`, GoCD roles were enhanced to support granular authorization.

This release adds support to configure access permissions for cluster profiles and elastic agent profiles. Support for other GoCD entities will be added in subsequent releases.

Please refer to the [Policy Documentation for Elastic Agent Configurations](https://docs.gocd.org/20.1.0/configuration/policy_in_gocd.html#elastic-agent-configuration) for more information.

<h4>UI/UX refresh</h4>

As part of our ongoing effort towards making the UI/UX consistent across all pages of GoCD, in this release we have rebuilt the following pages:

<h4>Pipeline Group Authorization Edit Page</h4>

    <%= image_tag 'releases/20.1.0/pipeline_grp_edit.png', alt: 'Pipeline Group Authorization Edit Page' %>
</figure>

<h4>Support for Postgres 10 and above</h4>

From this release the commercial GoCD PostgreSQL Addon will support Postgres version 10, 11 and 12.

Note: As per earlier [announcement](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/go-cd/EXwfvZZeLrM) this Addon is expected to be open sourced in Q2 of 2020.
