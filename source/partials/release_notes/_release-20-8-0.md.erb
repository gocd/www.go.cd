<h4>Materials Page</h4>

We have introduced a new Materials Page which lists all the configured materials. The page provides an ability to trigger a material update. For each material you can view the modifications with a corresponding link to VSM.

<h4>Support for Branch and Pull Requests</h4>

The GoCD Groovy DSL Configuration Plugin adds support for PR and branches in the [latest version](https://github.com/gocd-contrib/gocd-groovy-dsl-config-plugin/releases/tag/v1.1.0-233) of the plugin. The plugin provides an ability to templatize a pipeline or an entire workflow to run your builds against each branch and PR. Once a template is defined, the plugin scans the configured repository at a regular interval and for each available branch/PR it builds the corresponding pipelines.

Refer the [plugin documentation](https://github.com/gocd-contrib/gocd-groovy-dsl-config-plugin#support-for-branches-and-prs) for comprehensive examples to use this feature.

<h4>Stage Overview on Pipeline Activity Page</h4>

Staring this release, the users can utilize the stage overview on Pipeline Activity page. Earlier, it was only available on the Dashboard.
