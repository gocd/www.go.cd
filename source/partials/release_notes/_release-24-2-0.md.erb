This release is a maintenance and bug-fix release.

<h4>Java 21 support</h4>

GoCD is now built with, tested against and distributed with Java 21 LTS. Java 17 remains the minimum supported version
for bring-your-own-JRE setups. There were no specific changes needed to support Java 21, so the prior release 24.1.0
can be considered the first version that supports Java 21.

<h4>Windows installers no longer signed</h4>

Windows installers were previously code-signed with a "proper" Thoughtworks-issued OV code-signing certificate from
DigiCert that avoided Windows SmartScreen prompts. Due to both certificate cost and changes in requirements for OV
code-signing certificates (to have hardware-managed keys), in the short term this is no longer sustainable for GoCD.
Therefore installers are not be signed from 24.2.0 onwards.

GoCD can still be installed on Windows subsequent to this change, however users will need to review and accept
warnings from Windows during installation. Note that runtime binaries _are still signed_ as before, such as the Java
runtime and service wrapper binaries; so this change only affects installation - not runtime.

If you have a suggestion of approach to reinstate Windows code signing for a open-source project with limited funding,
or know other projects which have done so, [please reach out](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues)!

<h4>Security fixes</h4>

While we don't regularly release new GoCD versions to address container image dependencies, this release patches git
binaries within container images due to [CVE-2024-32002](https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-8h77-4q3w-gfgv)
and several other issues of particular concern to a build/deploy automation tool such as GoCD. You can read more about
the issues on [the GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/2024-05-14-securing-git-addressing-5-new-vulnerabilities/). Note that
at time of release, Debian images have [not had the most critical patch backported](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-32002)
to Debian 11 or 12, so the gocd-agent-debian variants for 24.2.0 are still vulnerable. Ubuntu variants are all patched
as are Alpine and Wolfi variants.

We regularly upgrade dependencies to mitigate known vulnerabilities from third party software (regardless of
whether they are known to affect GoCD), so upgrading to the latest release is always recommended from a security perspective.
