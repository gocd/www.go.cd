<h4>Default permissions on new pipeline groups</h4>

Starting from 20.4.0, all pipeline groups with no explicit permissions setup can only be viewed and operated by GoCD system administrators. Earlier, such pipeline groups could be viewed and operated by every valid user. This changes it to be secure by default.

<h4>UI/UX refresh</h4>

As part of the ongoing UI/UX refresh for improving the user experience, the Pipeline Config edit page has been rewritten to keep it in sync with other pages, while retaining existing functionality. Feedback/ideas are welcome, please open an issue [here](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues) to add your comments.
