<p class="information">
  Previously, there was a warning about not upgrading to 18.4. In 18.5, an issue around pipelines created using the pipeline config API showing twice on the dashboard was fixed. We haven't been able to replicate issue <%= link_to_issue 4723, '' %> around pipelines created using JSON and YAML plugins, we suspect it might be an issue with the individual's setup.

<h4>Performance fix</h4>

This release primarily addresses performance issue caused by a config save, which slows down several requests because of a long-running database query executed in order to update the dashboard.

We have performed some optimizations in order to significantly reduce the number of SQL calls executed. Read more about it at <%= link_to_issue 4706 %> and <%= link_to_issue '4705#issuecomment-386554649' %>.

<h4>Deprecations</h4>

  * As of release 18.2.0 the following (unversioned) APIs have been deprecated and will be removed in a release scheduled for June 2018:
      * The pipeline <%= link_to_versioned_api '18.1.0', 'pause-a-pipeline', 'pause api' %>.
      * The pipeline <%= link_to_versioned_api '18.1.0', 'unpause-a-pipeline', 'unpause api' %>.
      * The pipeline <%= link_to_versioned_api '18.1.0', 'releasing-a-pipeline-lock', 'unlock api' %>.
      * The pipeline <%= link_to_versioned_api '18.1.0', 'scheduling-pipelines', 'schedule api' %>.

    These APIs have been replaced with a versioned API and users are encouraged to use these instead.

  * The pipeline config API version 3 and version 4 have been deprecated as part of 18.2.0 and will be removed in a release scheduled for June 2018. Version 5 of the pipeline config API has been introduced to add the new pipeline unlock behavior attribute (<%= link_to_issue 3943 %>).

  * The elastic agent plugin extension version 1 and (a development verion 2) has been deprecated. These versions will be removed in a release scheduled for June 2018. Plugin developers should use version 3 of the elastic agent plugin api to allow adding support for agent status report and plugin status report. The docker, docker swarm, and ecs plugins have been migrated to the new versions, and users should upgrade their plugins to the latest version to see these new features.

  * The <%= link_to_versioned_api '18.2.0', 'plugin-info', 'Plugin Info API' %> v3 has been deprecated as part of 18.3.0. This version of the API will be removed in a release scheduled for July 2018. Version 4 of the API is available, and users are encouraged to use it.
