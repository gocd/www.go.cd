<h4>SSL support - Breaking Changes</h4>

In GoCD 20.2.0 we had [announced](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/7872) the removal of support for TLS on port 8154 using a self-signed certificate. To minimize disruptions, GoCD temporarily provided an option to enable the TLS port.

With this release, GOCD no longer supports configuring TLS within GoCD and will stop bringing up TLS on port 8154. If you have temporarily enabled TLS, and if the agents are configured to use the TLS port 8154 they will have to reconfigured to use port 8153, else the agent will stop connecting to the server.

<h4>Business Continuity</h4>

GoCD had a failover mechanism to decrease the impact of server failure. This feature was available as part of the paid offering through the Business Continuity Addon.
As part of open sourcing all the commercial components, the Business continuity feature has been incorporated into GoCD core. Please refer to the [documentation](https://docs.gocd.org/20.6.0/advanced_usage/business_continuity/introduction.html) to know more about the Business Continuity feature.

<h4>Data Sharing</h4>

The Data Sharing feature has been removed from GoCD.
