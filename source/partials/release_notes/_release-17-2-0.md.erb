#### Authorization Plugin Endpoint (beta)

GoCD currently supports password-file, LDAP and plugin based authentication.

In addition to authentication, GoCD offers authorization by restricting certain operations to specific users and groups of users ("roles").

Without the use of authorization plugins, roles can only be managed through GoCD and it does not provide an ability to use roles defined in systems used for authentication (for example in LDAP groups). With this limitation, administrators need to configure roles in multiples places.

The introduction of the authorization plugin endpoint (Beta) allows GoCD to delegate both authentication and authorization of users to plugins. The plugins will have the flexibility to use any identity service providers like LDAP, Google, GitHub etc.

Authorization Plugin Endpoint (beta) [documentation](https://plugin-api.gocd.io/current/authorization) is available. We have built [LDAP Authentication plugin](https://github.com/gocd/gocd-ldap-authentication-plugin) using the Authorization Plugin Endpoint, this plugin supports only authentication. We would recommend developers to write plugins which support both authentication and authorization and provide us feedback to enhance this endpoint.
