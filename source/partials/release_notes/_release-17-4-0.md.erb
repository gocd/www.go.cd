<h4>Authorization Plugin (Beta)</h4>

There has been more work done around fine tuning the Authorization Plugin endpoints, as part of this some of the plugin API calls have changed.  Action required: Early adopters of this extension will have to update their plugins to handle the updated API calls before upgrading Go. Refer Authorization Plugin Endpoint [documentation](https://plugin-api.gocd.org/current/authorization) for the latest changes.
