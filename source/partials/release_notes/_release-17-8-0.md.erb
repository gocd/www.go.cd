<h4>Pipeline as Code</h4>

With this release, GoCD supports [Pipeline as code](https://docs.gocd.org/current/advanced_usage/pipelines_as_code.html), out of the box. We've bundled the [JSON config repo plugin](https://github.com/tomzo/gocd-json-config-plugin) and the [YAML config repo plugin](https://github.com/tomzo/gocd-yaml-config-plugin) with the GoCD server.
A shout out to our core contributor [Tomasz Sętkowski](https://github.com/tomzo) for maintaining these plugins.

<h4>Amazon ECS Elastic Agent Plugin</h4>

<h4>Deprecations</h4>

Features that become superseded or irrelevant become *deprecated*, and are scheduled to be removed in some timeframe.

The following features have been deprecated. Please note the timeframe of when they will be removed.

* As of 17.5, support for in-built password file and LDAP/AD authentication have been deprecated. Support for these authentication mechanisms would be removed in 17.9 release (scheduled to be released in September 2017).

* The [Authorization Plugin](https://plugin-api.gocd.org/current/authorization/) endpoints were introduced as an extension to the existing Authentication Plugin endpoints, with this we are deprecating the Authentication Plugin endpoint. Support for this plugin would be removed in 18.1 (scheduled to be release in January 2018). Plugin developers are encouraged to migrate their plugins to use the new Authorization Plugins.
