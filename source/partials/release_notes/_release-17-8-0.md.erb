<h4>Pipeline as Code</h4>

With this release, GoCD supports [Pipeline as code](https://docs.gocd.org/current/advanced_usage/pipelines_as_code.html), out of the box. We've bundled the [JSON config repo plugin](https://github.com/tomzo/gocd-json-config-plugin) and the [YAML config repo plugin](https://github.com/tomzo/gocd-yaml-config-plugin) with the GoCD server.
A shout out to our core contributor [Tomasz Sętkowski](https://github.com/tomzo) for maintaining these plugins.

<h4>Amazon ECS Elastic Agent Plugin</h4>

Thoughtworks now offers a new commercial plugin which allows you to run elastic agents on Amazon ECS. The plugin takes care of spinning up and shutting down EC2 instances based on the need of your deployment pipeline. For more information about this, [click here](https://github.com/gocd/gocd-ecs-elastic-agent).

<h4>Deprecations</h4>

Features that become superseded or irrelevant become *deprecated*, and are scheduled to be removed in some timeframe.

The following features have been deprecated. Please note the timeframe of when they will be removed.

* As of 17.5, support for in-built password file and LDAP/AD authentication have been deprecated. Support for these authentication mechanisms would be removed in 17.9 release (scheduled to be released in September 2017). Existing configuration will be automatically migrated to use the new in-built password file and LDAP/AD authentication plugins. No other action necessary.

* As of 17.5, authentication plugin endpoints have been deprecated. Support for this plugin will be removed in 18.1 (scheduled to be released in January 2018). Plugin developers are encouraged to migrate their plugins to use the [Authorization Plugins](https://plugin-api.gocd.org/current/authorization/) that were introduced.
