<h4>Support for Java 8 and 10 removed</h4>

Support for Java 8 and 10 has been dropped from this release. This is in line with our <%= link_to 'official stance on Java', '/posts/2019-05-21-official-stance-on-java.html' %> we announced earlier this year post the Java Licensing Changes.

Starting 19.9.0, GoCD Server and Agent would only support Java 11 or 12. Support for Java 13 will be introduced soon. GoCD installers from 19.6.0 come with Java Runtime pre-bundled, so users no longer need to install it separately.

Users might need to upgrade the GoCD Agent Bootstrapper. More information can be found [here](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/7007)
