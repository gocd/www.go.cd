<h4>Introduce support for latest API version</h4>

GoCD API's are versioned, accessing an API endpoint required providing a version number as part of the `Accept: application/vnd.go.cd.v3+json` header.
GoCD now allows accessing the latest version of an API by omitting the version number in the request header `Accept: application/vnd.go.cd+json`. More information can be found [here](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/6620).

<h4>Ability to trigger a stage only if the previous stage has succeeded</h4>

Introduced the attribute `allowOnlyOnSuccess` for `approval` at stage level. If the attribute is set to `true`, the stage can be manually triggered only if the previous stage (if there is one) has resulted in success. More information can be found [here](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/6294).

<h4>Java 8 and 10 deprecation</h4>

Support for Java 8 and 10 will be removed in the next release of GoCD. GoCD installers come with Java Runtime pre-bundled, so users no longer need to install it separately.
The removal of Java versions is in line with the Java Licensing Changes we had announced earlier this year in this [blog](https://www.gocd.org/2019/05/21/official-stance-on-java/).
