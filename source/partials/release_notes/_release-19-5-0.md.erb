<h4>Replacing X.509 with simpler HTTPs token-based authentication for Agent-Server Communication - Beta feature</h4>

This is a beta feature: agent-server commnication can be toggled to use token-based authentication instead of self-signed X.509 certificates from the GoCD server.
To enable token-based auth, set the environment variable `GO_USE_TOKEN_AUTH` on the GoCD agent to `true`.

With token-based authentication enabled, agents can use load balancers or reverse proxy DNS names and not GoCD server DNS/IP. It is also not required to expose port 8154 on the GoCD server. TLS termination can happen at the reverse proxy instead.
