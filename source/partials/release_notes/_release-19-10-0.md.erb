<h4>Database cleanup</h4>

<div class="information">
  Please make sure that a GoCD server backup is taken before upgrading to 19.10.0.
</div>

<br>

There are some unnecessary data in the GoCD database which will be removed upon the first server start after upgrading to 19.10.0.
This cleanup will be done only for completed jobs and will remove historical data related to environment variables, artifact plans, resources and job-related metadata.
This will not affect any information in GoCD's configuration file.

Depending on the size of your database, you may experience some delay during startup while the data is being removed from the database. Please do not kill the GoCD server until the database upgrade completes.
If you do end up killing it, you might need to restore the database from the backup taken before this upgrade.

<h4>Improved Agents page</h4>

Agents page has been improved in this release. Now it will have 2 tabs - Static and Elastic - for easy viewing and searching of static and elastic agents.

<h4>Optional upstream dependencies</h4>

Introduced `ignore_for_scheduling` flag at the pipeline dependency level to improve GoCD's ability to model pipelines, as described in [this issue](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/4931).
This flag allows run of an upstream pipeline to be ignored by the downstream pipeline.
This is useful in cases where a downstream pipeline has multiple materials and wants to have fine-grained control over which materials cause it to run. Previously, this was available only for SCM materials (like git, mercurial, etc). This flag is available on the material edit page, Pipeline Config API and the bundled JSON/YAML config repo plugins.
