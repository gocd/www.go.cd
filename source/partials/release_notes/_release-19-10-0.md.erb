<h4>Improved Agents page</h4>

Agents page has been improved in this release. Now it will have 2 tabs - Static and Elastic - for easy viewing and searching of static and elastic agents.

<h4>Optional upstream dependencies</h4>

Introduced `ignore for scheduling` flag at the pipeline dependency material level to facilitate the pipeline scheduling model as described by a user in [this](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/4931) issue.
The flag comes handy in cases where downstream piepline should not run for the upstream pipeline changes, but only when SCM or other materials got any update and with that pick the changes from upstream pipeline.
This flag is available on material edit page, Pipeline Config API and bundled JSON/YAML Config repo plugins


<h4>Delete DB cruft during upgrade</h4>

* <%= link_to_commit '7d5d01f55320d7d70ec80d4af646120635842f61', "Delete cruft from the DB for jobs that are completed" %>

There are quite some unwanted data present in the DB tables `environmentVariables`, `artifactPlans`, `resources`, `jobAgentMetadata` for completed jobs.
DB cleanup scripts added in this release will delete those data only for completed jobs. Depending on the size of your database, you may experience some delay during startup as the data is being removed from the database. Ensure GoCD server backup is taken before upgrade. Please do not kill the GoCD server until the database upgrade completes.
