<h4>Delete DB cruft during upgrade</h4>

* <%= link_to_commit '7d5d01f55320d7d70ec80d4af646120635842f61', "Delete cruft from the DB for jobs that are completed" %>

There are quite some unwanted data present in the DB tables `environmentVariables`, `artifactPlans`, `resources`, `jobAgentMetadata` for completed jobs.
DB cleanup scripts added in this release will delete those data only for completed jobs.
On an upgrade to 19.10.0 server startup may experience slowness depending on the DB size due to these delete queries to complete. Please wait until the database upgrade completes
