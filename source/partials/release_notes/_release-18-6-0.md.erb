<h4>Breaking changes</h4>

  * URLs containing any un-normalized paths (`/../`, `./` and `/.`), semicolon (`;` and `%3B`), encoded forward-slash (`%2F`), backslash (`\`, `%5C`), encoded percent (`%25`) will be rejected.
  * The pipeline config API version 3 and version 4 have been removed. Please use version 5 of the <%= link_to_versioned_api '18.5.0', 'pipeline-config', 'pipeline config API' %>.
  * The elastic agent plugin extension version 1 and (a development version 2) has been removed. Plugin developers should use version 3 of the elastic agent plugin api to allow adding support for agent status report and plugin status report. The docker, docker swarm, and ecs plugins have been migrated to the new versions, and users should upgrade their plugins to the latest version to see these new features. Users using ECS plugin >= 4.0.0, docker swarm plugin >= 3.0.0, docker plugin >= 0.9.0 and kubernetes elastic agent >= 1.0.0 need not upgrade.
