<div class="release-date">Released on 02 Jun, 2017</div>
<h4>Important</h4>

There has been a critical security vulnerability identified with this release, fixes for the same have been provided in 17.7.0. If you are on 17.5.0, please upgrade immediately to 17.7.0 to keep your GoCD sever and agent secure.

<h4>Authorization Plugin</h4>

[Authorization Plugin](https://plugin-api.gocd.org/current/authorization/) extension was released as beta in GoCD 17.2.0, over the last couple of releases there has been more work done around fine tuning the endpoint. With this release we are taking the Authorization Plugin endpoint out of beta.

<b>Action required:</b> Early adopters of this extension will have to update their plugins to handle the updated API calls before upgrading GoCD. Refer to the Authorization Plugin Endpoint [documentation](https://plugin-api.gocd.io/current/authorization) for the latest changes.

The built-in LDAP and password file based authentication mechanisms have been deprecated and disabled in favor of separate plugins which implement the new Authorization Plugin extensions. The new plugins provide more functionality, with the benefit of allowing users to customize the behavior of these plugins. These plugins are bundled with the GoCD server, so no action will be required from users. Existing passwordFile and ldap configuration would be migrated to make use of these plugins.

* LDAP/AD authentication plugin

  The bundled [LDAP/AD authentication plugin](https://github.com/gocd/gocd-ldap-authentication-plugin) will now allow users to connect to and authenticate with multiple LDAP/AD servers in their organizations. Early adopters of this plugin using the experimental build will have to make changes to their config. Refer to the plugin [changelog](https://github.com/gocd/gocd-ldap-authentication-plugin/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#3601af8---bundled-with-gocd-v1750) to see the changes between experimental release to latest stable release.

* Password File Authentication Plugin

  The bundled [Password File Authentication Plugin](https://github.com/gocd/filebased-authentication-plugin) currently supports only SHA1 hashed passwords, but support for other hashing functions is [on its way](https://github.com/gocd/filebased-authentication-plugin/issues/13).

There are 2 new sets of pages that allows configuring the authorization plugins and mapping of GoCD roles to users.
