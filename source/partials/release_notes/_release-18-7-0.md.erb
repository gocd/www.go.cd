<h4>External Artifacts</h4>

Introduced support for publishing and fetching artifacts from an external artifacts store. 

* We have introduced a new  [Artifacts Plugin Extension](https://plugin-api.gocd.org/18.7.0/artifacts/) for plugin authors to write plugins which support artifact stores of their choice.
* Introduced Artifact Plugin for [Docker Registry](https://github.com/gocd/docker-registry-artifact-plugin) to store and fetch docker images from the docker registry.

<h4>Better encryption</h4>
We have moved towards using AES for encryption/decryption over DES. All DES cipher-text in cruise-config.xml will be migrated to AES cipher-text. Support for DES is retained to handle DES cipher-texts configured in config-repos. DES encryption is deprecated, check the deprecation notes for more details. 

<h4>Data Sharing</h4>
GoCD now shares some (non-personally identifiable) information about the instance, to help improve the experience and performance. All GoCD system administrators will see a notification message about it and will have a chance to review the information sent and make a decision about it.

<h4>New Loading... screen</h4>
The GoCD server now starts up into a "Loading ..." screen early on in the process. So, if you have scripts waiting on the port to be open, instead use the [server health API](https://api.gocd.org/current/#server-health), which will succeed with an HTTP status of 200 once the server is up. Till then, it'll fail with an HTTP status of 503.
