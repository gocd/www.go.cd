<h4> API Enhancements </h4>

<%= link_to_commit('6986dcc97d544d3087eb66423c70e21d6e77893c', "Added v2 of #{link_to_api 'environment-config', 'Environment Config API'} with support to PATCH environment-variables.", '3080') %>

<h4> Authorization Plugin (Beta)</h4>

There has been more work done around fine tuning the Authorization Plugin endpoints, as part of this some of the plugin API calls have changed.  Action required: Early adopters of this extension will have to update their plugins to handle the updated API calls before upgrading Go. Refer Authorization Plugin Endpoint [documentation](https://plugin-api.gocd.org/current/authorization) for the latest changes.

<h4> Breaking Changes</h4>

* On GoCD servers installed on windows or if using the zip installers, logs will now be written to logs directory instead of the working directory. This would be a breaking change only if there are custom scripts relying on the logs location.
* The [gocd/gocd-server](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-server/) docker image now uses alpine as the base image. The phusion images are still supported for GoCD 17.3.0 and can be found at [gocd-server-deprecated](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-server-deprecated/) should you wish to use it.
* The [gocd/gocd-server](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-server/) docker image no longer recognizes the `latest` tag. Please use `docker pull gocd/gocd-server:v17.3.0` instead.
* The `gocd/gocd-agent` docker image no longer exists. We have a variety of agent images for different distributions. If you wish to continue  with the old agent image, please use [gocd-agent-deprecated](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-agent-deprecated/) instead.

<h4> Deprecations</h4>

Features that become superseded or irrelevant become *deprecated*, and are scheduled to be removed in some timeframe.

The following features have been deprecated, along with the timeframe when they will be removed.

* As of release 17.1, version 2 of the <%= link_to_api 'template-config', 'Templates API' %> was deprecated. This version of the API will be removed in 17.4 release (scheduled to be released in April 2017). Version 3 of the API is available, and users are encouraged to use it.

* As of release 17.3, version 1 of the <%= link_to_api 'environment-config', 'Environment Config API' %> is deprecated. This version of the API will be removed in 17.6 release (scheduled to be released in June 2017). Version 2 of the API is available, and users are encouraged to use it.

<h4> Docker Images and AMIs</h4>

* The [GoCD server](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-server/) docker image is now alpine based with support for volume mounts, with this going forward there will be no more support for phusion based images.
* You can download the docker images for GoCD agents across the following operating systems - Centos [6](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-agent-centos-6/) & [7](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-agent-centos-7/) , Debian [7](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-agent-debian-7/) & [8](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-agent-debian-8/), Ubuntu [12.04](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-agent-ubuntu-12.04/), [14.04](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-agent-ubuntu-14.04/) & [16.04](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-agent-ubuntu-16.04/)
* We have also introduced an Amazon Linux based AMI for the GoCD Server making it very simple to launch GoCD server on your AWS EC2 instance.
* The old phusion based images have been moved, they can found under [gocd-server-deprecated](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-server-deprecated/) and [gocd-agent-deprecated](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-agent-deprecated/).
