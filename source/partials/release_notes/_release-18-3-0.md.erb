<h4>New Dashboard Page out of Beta</h4>
After we released the improved GoCD Dashboard (beta) in 18.2.0, we made several bug fixes and performance improvements based on feedback from our users. The GoCD dashboard improves performance for large GoCD instances with thousands of pipelines. In 18.3.0, we have replaced the older version of the dashboard with this improved dashboard which will be available as the default option to all GoCD users.

<h4>Enhancements to GoCD's Plugin Architecture</h4>
We have been working on a few improvements to our plugin architecture.

**Support for adding plugin alerts to GoCD's Errors and Warnings section:**
GoCD provides an [ability for plugins](https://plugin-api.gocd.org/18.3.0/notifications/#add-server-health-messages) to add Error and Warning messages. These messages will show up along with the GoCD's own Errors and Warnings. Plugins now have an ability to notify users with any plugin error or warning messages which shows up in GoCD.

  <%= image_tag 'releases/18.3.0/plugin-error-warning-messages.png', alt: 'Errors and Warnings from Plugins' %>
</figure>


**Multiple Extension Support for Plugins:**
Plugins can now implement [multiple extensions](https://github.com/gocd-contrib/gocd-multi-extension-plugin-example). This will allow plugin developers to create a single plugin to support multiple extensions which complement each other. E.g This would allow one to write a new GitHub PR workflow plugin with both SCM and Notification extensions.

The plugin info API v4 has been introduced to represent plugins which implement multiple extensions. The two changes are:

* "type" is no longer at plugin level. It's at an extension level.
* "extension_info" was an attribute. It's now a list called "extensions".

**Notification Extension V3:**
Introduced [Version 3](https://plugin-api.gocd.org/18.3.0/notifications) of Notification Extension. This version adds a new message to [notify agent state](https://plugin-api.gocd.org/18.3.0/notifications/#agent-status-changed) changes.

**Analytics Extension Point:**
There is a new analytics extension point which allows analytics to be embedded into GoCD. We are continuing to work on it and you'll hear more about it soon.


<h4>Docker Images</h4>

<h4>Deprecations</h4>
  * As of release 18.2.0 the following (unversioned) APIs have been deprecated and will be removed in a release scheduled for June 2018:
      * The pipeline <%= link_to_api 'pause-a-pipeline', 'pause api' %>
      * The pipeline <%= link_to_api 'unpause-a-pipeline', 'unpause api' %>
      * The pipeline <%= link_to_api 'releasing-a-pipeline-lock', 'unlock api' %>
      * The pipeline <%= link_to_api 'scheduling-pipelines', 'schedule api' %>

    These APIs have been replaced with a versioned API and users are encouraged to use these instead.

  * The pipeline config API version 3 and version 4 have been deprecated as part of 18.2.0 and will be removed in a release scheduled for June 2018. Version 5 of the pipeline config API has been introduced to add the new pipeline unlock behavior attribute (<%= link_to_issue 3943 %>).

  * The elastic agent plugin extension version 1 and (a development verion 2) has been deprecated. These versions will be removed in a release scheduled for June 2018. Plugin developers should use version 3 of the elastic agent plugin api to allow adding support for agent status report and plugin status report. The docker, docker swarm, and ecs plugins have been migrated to the new versions, and users should upgrade their plugins to the latest version to see these new features.

  * The <%= link_to_api 'plugin-info', 'Plugin Info API' %> v3 has been deprecated as part of 18.3.0. This version of the API will be removed in a release scheduled for July 2018. Version 4 of the API is available, and users are encouraged to use it.

  * The [Agent Docker Image for Debian 7](https://github.com/gocd/docker-gocd-agent-debian-7) is deprecated  as part of 18.3.0 and will be removed in a release scheduled for May 2018. Users should upgrade to a [newer version](https://github.com/gocd/docker-gocd-agent-debian-9) of the Debian image.


<h4>Breaking changes</h4>
  * The [old plugins page](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/4226) which was deprecated in 18.2.0 has been removed


<h4>Known Issues</h4>
* There are a few known minor issues when triggering pipelines on the new dashboard:
  * <%= link_to_issue 4647, 'Trigger buttons do not get disabled if the pipeline was force triggered and material update is in progress' %>
  * <%= link_to_issue 4452, 'Horizontal scroll appears in Trigger With Options Materials popup' %>
  * <%= link_to_issue 4481, 'CCTray corner cases: NullPointerException because of a pipeline not being in the config when the dashboard looks to update itself.' %>

* There is a known issue with API authentication:

  API requests that wait for a authentication challenge before sending the credentials in the `Authorization` header fail with `401`.
  This is due to a bug introduced in the pull request <%= link_to_pull_request 4585, '\'SPAs - redirect to login page if unauthorized\''%>
  The bug essentially responded with a `401` http response before the `WWW-Authenticate` header could be added. More details can be found in the github issue <%= link_to_issue 4682 %>.
