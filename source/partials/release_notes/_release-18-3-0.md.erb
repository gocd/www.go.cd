<h4>New Dashboard Page</h4>
The New Dashboard Page which was previewed in 18.2.0 is now the default dashboard for GoCD. We have made several improvements and bug fixes based on the feedback from the preview.

This improves performance for large GoCD instances with thousands of pipelines. It does so by:

* keeping track of the state of the dashboard in memory (instead of being pulled from the DB).
* rendering the response as a JSON (instead of HTML). This improves the rendering time by several hundred times on the server.
a javascript based frontend that is several thousand times faster on large instances, reducing the CPU usage of your browser. Your laptop battery will thank you. :)
* reduces the polling rate when the dashboard is shown in a browser tab that is hidden.

<h4>Plugin Infrastructure Enhancements</h4>
We have been working on a few improvements to our plugin infrastructure.

**Errors and Warnings support:**
We have a [new API](https://plugin-api.gocd.org/18.3.0/notifications/#add-server-health-messages) that allows plugins to add Errors and Warnings to the Go Server. These will show up along with the server's own Errors and Warnings. It will allow plugin developers to notify users if any errors or exceptions occur.

**Multiple Extension Support for Plugins:**
Plugins can now have [multiple extensions](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/pull/4123) be part of a single plugin JAR. This will allow plugin developers to create plugins with better functionality - for instance, the Notification and Task extension can be used in the same plugin.

The plugin infos API v4 has been updated to send multiple extensions. The two changes are:

* "type" is no longer at plugin level. It's at an extension level.
* "extension_info" was an attribute. It's now a list called "extensions".

**Analytics Extension Point:**
There is a new analytics extension point which allows analytics to be embedded into GoCD. We are continuing to work on it and you'll hear more about it soon.
