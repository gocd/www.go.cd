<h4>Bug Fixes</h4>
* <%= link_to_commit 'ab1ccf83aa90dfa3fc916ca892592e6db81717fc', 'Fix config file validation to not use file system to validate paths. This caused issues in certain cases where the server working directories were using symlinks.', 4026%> <%= link_to_issue 3984 %>
* <%= link_to_commit '6660a1b093d1c265f697c6e0ee16d3c146772a24', "Show 'console log not available' error in build details page's console tab when console.log file is not available", 3998%> <%= link_to_issue 3773 %> <%= link_to_issue 3650 %>
* <%= link_to_commit 'e48d9588988969c42c2f63b617cd9d08f8ca015d', 'Fixes console.log file not being available at server if websocket connection is closed while waiting for logs', 3999%> <%= link_to_issue 3986 %>

<h4>Security Fixes</h4>
* <%= link_to_commit '488712d7262dc6dd082aad3f2cf2d3ed05a3caa3', 'Token based approach for agent registration', 4014%>

  * Adds a new endpoint to get token from server in exchange of agent uuid. The token for a given agent is issued for unknown agents only - already registered or pending agents cannot request for a token.
  * Agent requests for a token before registration if required. This token is stored on agent's disk and reused for registration calls.

  Note: As a result of this fix, <%= link_to "Go-lang agents", "https://github.com/gocd-contrib/gocd-golang-agent" %> need to be updated to work with GoCD server versions 17.12 or higher, else the agent's registration would fail.
  Golang agent users can follow up with the author on <%= link_to "this", "https://github.com/gocd-contrib/gocd-golang-agent/issues/50" %> issue.

* Introduction of version 1 for <%= link_to_api "config-repo", "Config Repo API" %>.
* Introduction of version 5 for <%= link_to_api "pipeline-config", "Pipeline config API" %> (<%= link_to_issue 106 %>)

  This version accommodates changes made to <%= link_to("pipeline locking behavior", "https://docs.gocd.org/17.12.0/configuration/admin_lock_pipelines.html") %>. In addition to this, the representation of the origin attribute has also changed.

<h4>Deprecations</h4>

      </p></li>
      <li><p><%= link_to('Guest Login', 'https://github.com/gocd-contrib/gocd_auth_plugin_guest_user') %></p></li>
    </ul>
