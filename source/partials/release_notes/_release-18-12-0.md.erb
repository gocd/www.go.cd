<h4>Manage Config Repositories through UI</h4>

We have added a new Config Repositories page. This page lists existing config repos and allows CRUD (Create-Read-Update-Delete) operations for a config repo. This page has the ability to show errors and allows users to force a check of the repository.

   * The notification plugin extension version 3 has been deprecated. This version will be removed in a release scheduled for Mar 2019. Plugin developers should use version 4 of the notification plugin api.
