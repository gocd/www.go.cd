<h4>Manage Config Repositories through UI</h4>

We have added a new Config Repositories page. This page lists existing config repos and allows CRUD (Create-Read-Update-Delete) operations for a config repo. This page has the ability to show errors and allows users to force a check of the repository.

Support for DES is retained to support DES cipher-texts configured in config-repos and will be available till the last release of GoCD for the year 2018. The <%= link_to_versioned_api '18.8.0', 'encryption', 'Encryption API' %> is updated to return a AES cipher-text, users are encouraged to update their DES cipher-texts in config-repos using this API.
   * The elastic agent plugin extension version 3 has been deprecated. This version will be removed in a release scheduled for Mar 2019. Plugin developers should use version 4 of the elastic agent plugin api to allow adding support for job completion request. The docker, docker swarm, kubernetes and ecs plugins have been migrated to the new versions, and users should upgrade their plugins to the latest version to see these new features.
   * The notification plugin extension version 3 has been deprecated. This version will be removed in a release scheduled for Mar 2019. Plugin developers should use version 4 of the notification plugin api.

<h4>Breaking Changes</h4>
