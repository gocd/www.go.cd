<h4>Improvements</h4>

  * <%= link_to_commit '7203cb371a2ce06a18a7bbc5c2a317cd93a074cf', 'Allow artifact plugins to introduce new environment variables to be used by subsequent tasks.', 5188 %>


<h4>Performance Improvements</h4>

  * In this release, users with ~100 or above agents will see a significant performance improvement on the agents page and when invoking the agents API. In 18.10, due to upgrading some libraries to support Java 9 (and beyond) there were some performance regressions with the agents page (and the agents API).

<h4>Docker Images</h4>

We have added support for the GoCD agents for [Fedora-28](https://github.com/gocd/docker-gocd-agent-fedora-28) and [Fedora-29](https://github.com/gocd/docker-gocd-agent-fedora-29).


<h4>Deprecations</h4>

   * With the introduction of AES for encryption/decryption in release 18.7.0, we are deprecating support for DES. Support for DES is retained to support DES cipher-texts configured in config-repos and will be available till the last release of GoCD for the year 2018. The <%= link_to_versioned_api '18.8.0', 'encryption', 'Encryption API' %> is updated to return an AES cipher-text and users are encouraged to update their DES cipher-texts in config-repos using this API.
   * The elastic agent plugin extension version 3 has been deprecated. This version will be removed in a release scheduled for Mar 2019. Plugin developers should use version 4 of the elastic agent plugin api to allow adding support for job completion request. The docker, docker swarm, kubernetes and ecs plugins have been migrated to the new versions, and users should upgrade their plugins to the latest version to see these new features.
   * The notification plugin extension version 3 has been deprecated. This version will be removed in a release scheduled for Mar 2019. Plugin developers should use version 4 of the notification plugin api.
   * The analytics plugin extension version 1 has been deprecated. This version will be removed in a release scheduled for Mar 2019. Plugin developers should use version 2 of the analytics plugin api.


<h4>Breaking Changes</h4>

  * The alpine 3.5 based docker image for [GoCD agent](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-agent-alpine-3.5/) has been removed since alpine 3.5 has reached end of life.
  * The Template Config API v3 has been removed. <%= link_to_versioned_api '18.8.0', 'template-config', 'Version 4' %> of the API is available, and users are encouraged to use it.
  * The Pipeline Config API v5 has been removed. <%= link_to_versioned_api '18.8.0', 'pipeline-config', 'Version 6' %> of the API is available, and users are encouraged to use it.
  * The <%= link_to_versioned_api('18.11.0', 'get-stage', 'Feeds API for getting a Stage') %> no longer supports the `pipeline_label` URL parameter. Users should use the `pipeline_counter` parameter instead.
