<h4>Improved configurations for Git and Mercurial material credentials</h4>

Introduced `username` and `password` (or `encryptedPassword`) attributes on Git and Mercurial materials. Users can now use these fields to setup credentials in a secure manner, instead of putting credentials in the URL. The YAML, JSON and Groovy config repo <%= link_to 'plugins', 'https://www.gocd.org/plugins/#config-repo' %> have been updated to allow these additional fields on material definitions.
Users can also utilize the newly introduced `branch` attribute on Mercurial materials to specify the branch instead of specifying in the URL.

**NOTE:**
* Users are advised to move their credentials from the URLs into these attributes. Secured attributes like `password` and `encrypted_password` are stored as encrypted value in the configuration.


**WARNING:**
* Changing the material configuration will be treated as a new material by GoCD and can trigger dependent pipelines.

<h4>Introduced support for Java 12</h4>

Starting this release, GoCD has now added support for Java 12. All the docker images and installers for Windows and OSX are bundled with the supported Java versions.

See this <%= link_to 'blog', 'https://www.gocd.org/2019/05/21/official-stance-on-java/' %> for more information.
