<h4>Some feature</h4>

Introduced `username` and `password` (or `encryptedPassword`) attributes on Git and Mercurial materials. Users can now use these fields to setup credentials in a secure manner, instead of putting credentials in the URL. The YAML, JSON and Groovy config repo plugins have been updated to allow these additional fields on material definitions.
Users can also utilize the newly introduced `branch` attribute on Mercurial materials tp specify the branch instead of specifying in the URL.

**NOTE:**
* Users are advised to move their credentials from the URLs into these attributes as it more secure way of defining the same and will stored as encrypted value in configuration.


**WARNING:**
* Changing the material config will be treated as a new material by the GoCD which might trigger other pipelines with the same material configs.
