<h4> GoCD Maintenance mode </h4>

GoCD maintenance mode can be utilized by the GoCD system administrator to safely restart or upgrade the GoCD server without having any running jobs reschedule when the server is back up. Initiating maintenance mode will cause various sub-systems of GoCD to stop working making sure server is not performing any operation.

<h4>Improved Pipeline as Code experience.</h4>

Continuing on the road towards improving GoCD's pipelines as code / config repositories experience, this release introduces the ability to export a GoCD pipeline to a format which can be used by the config repository plugins (for instance, YAML or JSON plugins). You can then check in these pipeline definitions to a repository and remove them from GoCD's config.
