<h4>Performance fix</h4>

This release primarily addresses performance issue caused by a config save, which slows down several requests because of a long-running database query executed in order to update the dashboard.

We have performed some optimizations in order to significantly reduce the number of SQL calls executed. Read more about it <% link_to_issue 4706, 'here' %> and <%= link_to_issue '4705#issuecomment-386554649', 'here' %>.
