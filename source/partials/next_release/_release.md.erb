<h4>Authorization Plugin</h4>

There has been more work done around fine tuning the Authorization Plugin endpoints and as part of this some of the plugin API calls have changed.

Action required: Early adopters of this extension will have to update their plugins to handle the updated API calls before upgrading Go. Refer to the Authorization Plugin Endpoint [documentation](https://plugin-api.gocd.io/current/authorization) for the latest changes.

The built-in LDAP and password file based authentication mechanisms have been deprecated in favor of separate plugins that provide more functionality, with the benefit of allowing users to customize the behavior of these plugins. These plugins are bundled with the GoCD server, so no action will be required from users.

* LDAP authentication plugin

  The bundled [LDAP authentication plugin](https://github.com/gocd/gocd-ldap-authentication-plugin) will now allow users to connect to and authenticate with multiple LDAP servers in their organizations.

* Password File Authentication Plugin

  The bundled [Password File Authentication Plugin](https://github.com/gocd/filebased-authentication-plugin) currently supports only SHA1 hashed passwords, but support for other hashing functions is [on its way](https://github.com/gocd/filebased-authentication-plugin/issues/13).

There are 2 new sets of pages that allows configuring the authorization plugins and mapping of GoCD roles to users.

  Large filesystems like EFS, have an amount of storage that exceeds what can be addressed with a java `long` type (<code>2<sup>63</sup>-1</code>). Any storage space greater than <code>2<sup>63</sup>-1</code>, will be shown to be <code>2<sup>63</sup>-1</code>.
