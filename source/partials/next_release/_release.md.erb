<h4>Support for Java 10 and 11</h4>

  GoCD now supports Java 10 and 11. With Java moving towards a 6 month cadence for newer releases we are evaluating the process to keep in sync with the new cadence.  

<h4>Environments Page</h4>

  Originally the `Environments` page grouped the pipelines by environment with an option for admins to edit the environment. With the introduction of the new pipeline dashboard users have an option to group the pipelines by `Pipeline Group` or `Environment`. 

  With this release we have moved the environments page under the Admin tab. This page lists all the configured environments with an option to edit them.

<h4>Elastic Agent Extension V4</h4>

  Upgraded the Elastic Agent Extension to [Version 4](https://plugin-api.gocd.org/18.10.0/elastic-agents). With this version GoCD notifies the plugin on completion of Job
run by an elastic agent.

<h4>Deprecations</h4>

  * The alpine 3.5 based docker image for [gocd agent](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-agent-alpine-3.5/) has been deprecated and will not be built after November 2018 release of GoCD. This will be done as alpine 3.5 will reach [end-of-life](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Alpine_Linux:Releases) in November 2018.
   * With the introduction of AES for encryption/decryption in release 18.7.0, we are deprecating support for DES. Support for DES is retained to support DES cipher-texts configured in config-repos and will be available till the last release of GoCD for the year 2018. The <%= link_to_versioned_api '18.8.0', 'encryption', 'Encryption API' %> is updated to return a AES cipher-text, users are encouraged to update their DES cipher-texts in config-repos using this API.
  * The Pipeline Config API v5 has been deprecated in release 18.7.0. This version of the API will be removed in a release scheduled for November 2018. <%= link_to_versioned_api '18.8.0', 'pipeline-config', 'Version 6' %> of the API is available, and users are encouraged to use it.
  * The Template Config API v3 has been deprecated in release 18.7.0. This version of the API will be removed in a release scheduled for November 2018. <%= link_to_versioned_api '18.8.0', 'template-config', 'Version 4' %> of the API is available, and users are encouraged to use it.

<h4>Breaking Changes</h4>

  * We have stopped building ubuntu 12.04 based docker image for [gocd agent](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-agent-ubuntu-12.04/) as ubuntu 12.04 is now end-of-life.
