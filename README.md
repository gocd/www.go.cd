# gocd.org - website [![Build Status](https://snap-ci.com/gocd/www.go.cd/branch/master/build_image)](https://snap-ci.com/gocd/www.go.cd/branch/master)


This repository hosts code for the website at [https://gocd.org](https://gocd.org).

## Build instructions

To setup a live server:

```
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec middleman serve
```

You can then access the page at http://localhost:4567

If you want to build the static site locally, do this:

```
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec rake
```

Then, the site will be available at build/ and can be served locally, if you choose.
