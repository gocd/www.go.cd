			<h4 class="features__title"> Model complex workflows</h4>
			<p>Go's <span class="feature_word">pipelines</span> are the building blocks with which you model your deployment pipeline. With Go, you can easily configure dependencies for fast feedback and on-demand deployment. Parallel and sequential execution work exactly as you would expect. <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/model-everything-fail-fast">Here's a glimpse</a> of what can be done in Go.</p>
			<p>With its <span class="feature_word">fan-in/fan-out dependency management</span>, Go always tries to do the "right thing," avoiding spurious builds and unverified configurations.

			<h4 class="features__title">Promote trusted artifacts</h4>
			<p>Any particular pipeline instance is anchored to a particular changeset. Go also makes it easy to <span class="feature_word">pass once-built binaries</span> between stages so you know exactly what's being deployed and that the binary has been tested.</p>

			<p>Clichéd as it may sound, Go's real power is in the visibility it provides over your end-to-end workflow. Go's <span class="feature_word">Value Stream Map</span> allows you to follow a change from commit to deploy with a glance. And when things go wrong, it is easy to see both the upstream cause and the downstream effects.</p>

			<h4 class="features__title">Deploy any version, any time</h4>
			<p>Go's <span class="feature_word">manual triggers</span> allow you to deploy any known good version of your application to wherever you like. Beyond reliable pushes to production, this empowers QA teams with self-service environments. And, if necessary, it's securable and auditable.</p>

			<p>Verification is a key piece of any deployment pipeline. Go will <span class="feature_word">execute tests</span> written in most languages or frameworks. Go's agent grid provides parallel and cross-platform execution. Go's <span class="feature_word">test reporting</span> will tell you in exactly which changeset and on which platform a test started breaking, which comes in extremely handy when fixing a complex broken build.</p>

			<h4 class="features__title">Compare builds</h4>
			<p>Go's <span class="feature_word">compare builds</span> feature can provide a simple bill of materials for any deployment. Perhaps more powerful is its ability to compare the content - both files and commit messages - across any two arbitrary builds. This is invaluable when troubleshooting a broken pipeline.</p>

			<p>Go's <span class="feature_word">agent grid</span> eliminates bottlenecks, providing trivial parallel execution across pipelines, platforms, versions, branches, etc.</p>

			<h4 class="features__title">Keep configuration tidy</h4>
			<p>Easily re-use pipeline configurations via Go's <span class="feature_word">template system</span>. This makes managing pipelines for versions and branches easy as pie.</p>

			<p>While most enterprise applications go overboard with their permission model, Go seeks to provide just enough. In particular, Go supports <span class="feature_word">auditable deployment</span> and can <span class="feature_word">delegate the configuration of pipelines</span> to users without full-blown admin privileges.</p>
